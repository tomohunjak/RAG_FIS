"Alaoua, A.; Mohammed, M.";A Bayesian learning approach for predictive resilience in engineer-to-order supply chains;Supply Chain Analytics;10.1016/j.sca.2025.100190;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105025204551&doi=10.1016%2Fj.sca.2025.100190&partnerID=40&md5=5d5d1be4092ed2e0f5aa0a5db6570295;Accurate supplier lead time prediction is critical for maintaining resilience in Engineer-to-Order (EtO) supply chains, characterized by high customization and uncertainty. This study develops a simulation-based predictive framework combining log-normal sensitivity analysis, Internet of Things (IoT)-driven adaptation, and Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) updating to conceptually investigate predictive resilience. Using industry-informed synthetic data that reflect realistic variability in lead times and operational disruptions, the framework is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulation conducted across sixteen parameter scenarios under both moderate and high variability conditions, providing a proof-of-concept tool that illustrates potential operational benefits in EtO supply chains and establishes a foundation for future empirical validation. Results show that the baseline log-normal model performs adequately in stable conditions, its accuracy deteriorates under parameter shifts, and the IoT-adjusted framework reduces sensitivity to variability, while the BNN-enhanced model further improves robustness by jointly modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The approach advances supply chain analytics by integrating statistical modeling, real-time IoT feedback, and Bayesian learning, offering theoretical insights and simulation-based, conceptual decision-support implications for supplier management and risk analysis.

Continuously released by wastewater treatment plants, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and adaptable methodologies for their risk assessment in both retrospective and prospective ways, aiming to describe uncertainty to produce a reliable risk estimate. Current methods for quantitative health risk assessment for PFAS are mostly deterministic and case-specific, with very few studies available, primarily due to limited knowledge about fate, transport, and toxicity, as well as a lack of suitable data necessitating lab- and time-intensive pilot experiments. Here, a Bayesian network-based risk assessment approach is proposed to model health risk associated with perfluorooctanoic acid through consumption of salad irrigated with reclaimed wastewater. This method, built upon evidence from the literature and experts knowledge, accounts for health risk assessment across conventional exposure scenarios, providing a valuable decision-making and risk management tool for water utilities. Its flexibility and universality allow for application even in data-scarce environments, with robustness improving as new evidence becomes available. The proposed risk model is intended to describe the multi-barrier approach perspective, facilitating forecasting and risk mitigation throughout the supply chain, and supporting efficient water management and reuse. In conclusion, the validated model was applied to data collected during a one-year monitoring campaign at two wastewater treatment plants, revealing a low risk of PFOA exposure.

We develop an optimization model that incorporates several features, including (1) partial failure of facilities (instead of complete shutdown) resulting in interrupted supply capacity, (2) the effect of disruption on customer demand, and (3) the possibility to use multistrategies to mitigate disruption. We formulate a mixedinteger linear programming model to determine the optimal location of facilities and assignment of customers to opened facilities. An accelerated Benders decomposition method with valid inequalities is proposed to solve the problem. We discuss the computational efficiency of this decomposition procedure using two case studies as well as randomized data. For medium- and large-sized instances, our approach can decrease computational times by as much as 60%on average.Weanalyze the effect of multimitigation policies on the optimal solution and the model performance. Compared with the existing single-mitigation strategy models, we find that our model reduces the need for redundancy by as much as 50% and improves the total cost by as much as 8% in our case studies.

The transition to renewable energy sources has led to a substantial reduction in the costs and greenhouse gases emissions of electricity production. This study proposes a hybrid approach consisting of a recurrent neural network and an optimization model for designing a resilient electricity supply chain based on wind and solar energies. First, the electricity demand is forecast using the long short-term memory algorithm. Second, based on the forecast demand, a two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for designing an electricity supply chain under disruption risks. Partial and complete disruptions in power lines and facilities, including power plants, distribution and subtransmission substations, and low-power solar panel farms are considered. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain by making optimal decisions on facility location; technology selection for power plants; setting up transmission lines; and the quantity of power generation, power transmission, and power shortage in low- and high-voltage energy consumption systems. Three strategies are adopted to enhance the supply chain's resilience: multiple renewable energy sources, multiple power transmission lines, and lateral power lines. Lastly, the Sistan and Baluchestan Electric Power Distribution Company in Iran is used as a case study for this work to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, analyze the findings, and derive relevant managerial insights."

A robust stochastic optimization and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) in the cost function is utilized to develop the model. This model's objective function incorporates the expected value, maximum cost, and CVaR cost. The OI and BCT platforms are suggested for an antifragile policy against disruption. In addition, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and energy consumption are proposed as sustainability requirements. Eventually, minimum demand satisfaction and resilience facilities by incorporating capacity based on specific scenarios are added to the model for an agile strategy. This research entails several parties, including vendors supplying the primary components and manufacturers creating products based on customer preferences. OI and BCT platforms aim to receive demand based on customer specifications and facilitate rapid transactions between components. Risk-averse decision-makers utilize a polyhedral Data-Driven Robust Optimization (DDRO) approach to manage uncertainty and flexible sets. Incorporating OI and BCT as antifragility instruments resulted in a 0.2% cost reduction for VSCNDOIBCT compared to when OI and BCT were not considered. This research suggests that integrating OI and BCT positively affects SC performance overall. The decreasing rate, DDRO coefficient, agility rate, demand variation, and problem size were subjected to a sensitivity analysis.

This study presents a comprehensive framework that integrates machine learning, decision-making models, and blockchain technology to enhance predictive models and evacuation strategies in wildfire management. The proposed framework addresses all three phases of wildfire management, including predisaster, during-disaster, and postdisaster, by developing geospatial-based machine learning models to predict wildfire occurrence, spread, and speed, which enable early identification of high-risk areas. Moreover, this study proposes innovative risk mitigation strategies through decision-making models for wildfire suppression operations, evacuation planning with ridesharing options, and relief distribution network design to optimize resource allocation and evacuation efficiency. Furthermore, developing a decentralized decision support framework integrated with social media provides real-time notifications to facilitate information sharing and enhance coordination among stakeholders. The implementation of this framework aims to minimize losses, improve resource utilization, and strengthen community resilience by developing advanced technologies and data-driven insights in wildfire management. © 2026 Elsevier Inc.

The issue of supplier selection and evaluation in accordance with green and resilient principles has received little attention in the electronic industry. So, the present study aims to consider both criteria of resilience and greenness in a new supplier selection model. This study presents an integrated decision-making method based on the fuzzy set theory and data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach for supplier selection in a supply chain network in an electronic manufacturing company. The fuzzy set theory was used for analyzing suppliers' indicator weights, the suppliers' performance, and rating them with respect to subcriteria. Then, the obtained data were aggregated to classify and prepare them for use in a version assurance region of the DEA method with one dummy input and three output variables to rank the suppliers. The performance of the proposed DEA-based model has been verified through the sensitivity analysis and it has been validated by the existing FIS-based model in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed DEA-based model can be designed with any number of suppliers and criteria and subcriteria. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

An effective risk management process becomes as a consequence mandatory, especially at the tactical planning level. The aim of this article is to present a risk-oriented integrated procurement–production approach for tactical planning in a multi-echelon SC network involving multiple suppliers, multiple parallel manufacturing plants, multiple subcontractors and several customers. An originality of the work is to combine an analytical model allowing to build feasible scenarios and a multi-criteria approach for assessing these scenarios. The literature has mainly addressed the problem through cost or profit-based optimisation and seldom considers more qualitative yet important criteria linked to risk, like trust in the supplier, flexibility or resilience. Unlike the traditional approaches, we present a method evaluating each possible supply scenario through performance-based and risk-based decision criteria, involving both qualitative and quantitative factors, in order to clearly separate the performance of a scenario and the risk taken if it is adopted. Since the decision-maker often cannot provide crisp values for some critical data, fuzzy sets theory is suggested in order to model vague information based on subjective expertise. Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to determine both the performance and risk measures correlated to each possible tactical plan. The applicability and tractability of the proposed approach is shown on an illustrative example and a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influence of criteria weights on the selection of the procurement–production plan. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Suppliers have been often identified as the main source of risks in creating the massive levels of disruptions in supply chains. That is why resilient supplier selection can greatly reduce purchase costs and time delays and can create stability in business practices, thereby increasing competitiveness and customer satisfaction. Pharmaceutical companies play an important key role in the health of society, and these companies are frequently exposed to this disorder. Hence, this paper tries to propose a new integrated approach based on traditional (delivery, quality, price, technology level) and resilient criteria for supplier selection in pharmaceutical companies using the Z-number data envelopment analysis (Z-DEA) model and artificial neural network (ANN). In the proposed approach, expert opinions have been provided based on Z-numbers due to the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in the evaluation process. This is the first study that evaluates the pharmaceutical industry based on traditional and resilience factors by presenting a methodological structure under the uncertainty environment. Here, a fuzzy mathematical model is used. A real case study is utilized to indicate the applicability of the proposed approach to resilient supplier selection in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, the suppliers are ranked and the best supplier is selected regarding the reliable level of α. To indicate the features and capabilities of the selected approach, the performance analysis is presented in three parts. First, the obtained results are compared with a fuzzy DEA (FDEA) method in the form of validation and verification. Second, a sensitivity analysis is executed to show the effects of different criteria on ranking results, and the price index is identified as the most important evaluation criteria. Third, a predictive model is presented based on ANN that is able to detect the efficiency or inefficiency of suppliers with an 83% accuracy. © 2023 The Author(s)

This leads to supply chain disruptions and failure to align with other stakeholders. Contractors aim to develop a resilient supply chain by mitigating these risks regarding delivery and controlling costs by being kept well informed of potential delays. In this paper, the authors propose a novel digital twin-enabled model for mapping delivery networks and monitoring supply chain risks. The contingency and disruption amid the construction supply chain provide indisputable evidence for the need for digital twin technology to ensure visibility. The collected data shows the relationship between materials and corresponding machines (MCM) via a hidden transition and usage plan. The paper presents a new improved Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach entitled the Multi-Material & Machine Hidden Markov Model (M3HMM), as it considers the relationships of usage plans for MCM to forecast delivery and ensure supply chain resilience. The results show that with respect to resilience, M3HMM consistently performs the best compared with other algorithms, including LR, SVR, GMM, LSTM and HMM. It also ultimately enables industrial contractors to enhance their predictive and reactive decision-making, reducing the risk. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical tensions heightened disruption risks for SNs. We propose a methodological framework to guide the design of resilient SNs, with a focus on efficient resilience. In fact, despite an increasing economic and social interest in SN resilience and a large variety of qualitative resilience frameworks, there is a lack of model-based frameworks to guide decision makers in the complex task of designing resilient SNs. Differently to the existing literature, that mostly focuses on industry- or disruption-specific approaches, the framework of this paper is general, independent from sectors and causes. It consists of three steps to guide practitioners through model-based stress testing of their SNs: it integrates and organises methods from the literature, from the selection of data to be collected to the validation of the resilient and efficient SN. We illustrate the application of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics at each phase using real-life case studies data supplemented by literature references. Finally, we present an industrial case study with the step-by-step application of the framework highlighting its strengths and objectives. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This transformation offers numerous benefits, including enhanced patient data collection, processing, and informed treatment decisions. Despite these advantages, digital adoption brings several security challenges that pose considerable risks to overall healthcare service delivery. Additionally, connected medical devices must comply with sector-specific regulatory requirements to ensure trustworthiness and facilitate their broader adoption in the healthcare sector. There is, therefore, a pressing need to understand and manage these risks and compliance issues to secure and strengthen the resilience of healthcare systems. This work addresses these needs by introducing a novel Risk and Conformity Assessment Framework and Certification Scheme, implemented within an agile Information Security Management System context to enhance the security and resilience of healthcare systems. The framework leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) in risk management practices, improving security assessments, risk prediction, security control implementation, and continuous monitoring. AI algorithms analyze large data volumes from various sources, enabling efficient processing and the identification of potential risk patterns. Additionally, AI-driven automation tools ensure consistent deployment of security controls, while continuous AI monitoring detects abnormal activities and enables rapid response to security incidents. The proposed Cybersecurity Certification Scheme incorporates AI-based security assessments into the certification process, facilitating efficient conformity assurance. This scheme also promotes a collaborative approach with relevant regulatory bodies to achieve compliance. While this work introduces a conceptual framework, its implementation and potential refinements remain subjects for future research. Further studies are necessary to validate its effectiveness, enhance its components, and evaluate its practical application in real-world healthcare environments. © The Author(s) 2025.

Despite the significant challenges in this industry, such as government regulations, taxing policies, raw material sales, and disruptions, there are rare studies that have considered mining supply chain network design. Thus, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear bi-level programming model under operational and disruption risks to design a robust and resilient mining supply chain network. The government is considered as the leader that aims to decrease the sales of raw materials, boost the export of final products, and maximize its profit. Moreover, the closed-loop mining supply chain is introduced as the follower level that maximizes the total profit. In other words, this study presents a bi-level model that balances the export of raw materials and final products, for the first time. Additionally, a data envelopment analysis approach is applied to rank the candidate mine areas and reduce the model's complexity. Finally, a real-world case study of the Iranian iron ore supply chain is applied to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the addressed model. The results indicate that the effect of raw material price on the upper level is 22% higher than the lower level under the same conditions. Moreover, the exchange rate has a great impact on the objective functions of both levels. Furthermore, Yazd province has great potential to be introduced as a steel pole in Iran. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

Biodiesel is a potential fossil fuel replacement that can be used in engines without modification. However, the commercial feasibility of biodiesel production is a major challenge. A resilient and cost-efficient biodiesel supply chain network is essential for commercialization. In addition, disruption risks arising from operational downtime, labor strikes, natural disasters, and uncertainty embedded in the data compromise the effectiveness of tactical and strategic level supply chain planning. In line with these requirements, an animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain model that reduces the total system cost and accounts for both disruption and operational risks is proposed. The proposed model determines the optimal production–distribution quantities and supports facility location and capacity decisions against multiple supply and demand interruption scenarios. A novel interactive solution technique, robust possibilistic flexible programming, which enables decision-makers to incorporate flexibility into model constraints, has been introduced. Furthermore, a p-measure constraint that ensures the lowest cost under disruption scenarios is used to control network reliability. A real-world case study is used to assess the suggested model and solution technique's applicability. The findings demonstrate a tradeoff between system reliability and nominal cost, showing that with a marginal increase in overall cost, the decisions can be secured against an uncertain environment. Biodiesel producers and distributors, as well as investors and regulators, may potentially benefit from the proposed model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

A number of efforts have been devoted to define SCRR or to develop risk mitigation strategies for their improvement. However, a key question remaining to be answered is how SCRR should be quantified. Existing methods are insufficient in addressing this question on two important fronts: First, they do not adequately represent the interdependencies between different supply chain nodes; second, they do not allow for the modeling of actionable decisions and thus cannot be used to guide improvement strategies. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a unified framework for evaluating SCRR that internalizes design inputs and is flexible to varying degrees of data availability. The proposed framework captures risks involved in the supply, the demand, the firm itself, and the external environment. It also contributes to the literature by relating SCRR to the supply chain’s risk-mitigating capabilities prior to or postdisruptions. A novel method using the supply chain’s inherent buyer–supplier relationships is designed to model node interdependencies. Two example applications are discussed to demonstrate how this framework can be utilized to assist in reliable and resilient supply chain design. © 2017 IEEE."

In a globalized economy, outages of productive capital and infrastructure have the potential to spread around the world. In order to address those repercussions in the framework of a risk analysis or a resilience strategy, a disaster’s indirect consequences on the economic supply network need to be understood. We developed a numerical model to simulate these indirect effects along global supply chains for time scales of days to months. This article is the first in a series of four, which describes the damage-propagation model. In this first paper, we describe the pure damage propagation within the network and focus on the fundamental propagation of supply failure between production sites including their input and output storages and transport-related time delay. Idealized examples are presented to illustrate the dynamic damage propagation. Further articles will extend the dynamics to include demand changes due to the perturbation in the supply, the possibility to extend production to compensate for production failure, price responses and adaptive changes in the economic supply network. The underlying global supply network is based on data from multi-regional input–output tables. Transportation times are derived from geographic distances. In the initial model version presented here, indirect production losses are caused by cascading effects. They are propagated within the network without significant reduction in loss (damage conservation).

Shipments of essential and life-saving products, ranging from pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and healthcare, to manufacturing, have been significantly impacted or delayed, making the global SCs vulnerable. A better understanding of the shipment risks can substantially reduce that nervousness. Thenceforth, this paper proposes a few Deep Learning (DL) approaches to mitigate shipment risks by predicting ”if a shipment can be exported from one source to another”, despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed DL methodologies have four main stages: data capturing, de-noising or pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The feature extraction stage depends on two main variants of DL models. The first variant involves three recurrent neural networks (RNN) structures (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)), and the second variant is the temporal convolutional network (TCN). In terms of the classification stage, six different classifiers are applied to test the entire methodology. These classifiers are SoftMax, random trees (RT), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed DL models is evaluated based on an online dataset (taken as a case study). The numerical results show that one of the proposed models (i.e., TCN) is about 100% accurate in predicting the risk of shipment to a particular destination under COVID-19 restrictions. Unarguably, the aftermath of this work will help the decision-makers to predict supply chain risks proactively to increase the resiliency of the SCs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Considering the availability of data and the huge number of supply chains that had their weak links exposed during COVID-19, the objective of the study is to employ artificial intelligence to develop supply chain resilience to withstand extreme disruptions such as COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: We adopted a qualitative approach for interviewing respondents using a semi-structured interview schedule through the lens of organisational information processing theory. A total of 31 respondents from the supply chain and information systems field shared their views on employing artificial intelligence (AI) for supply chain resilience during COVID-19. We used a process of open, axial and selective coding to extract interrelated themes and proposals that resulted in the establishment of our framework. Findings: An AI-facilitated supply chain helps systematically develop resilience in its structure and network. Resilient supply chains in dynamic settings and during extreme disruption scenarios are capable of recognising (sensing risks, degree of localisation, failure modes and data trends), analysing (what-if scenarios, realistic customer demand, stress test simulation and constraints), reconfiguring (automation, re-alignment of a network, tracking effort, physical security threats and control) and activating (establishing operating rules, contingency management, managing demand volatility and mitigating supply chain shock) operations quickly. Research limitations/implications: As the present research was conducted through semi-structured qualitative interviews to understand the role of AI in supply chain resilience during COVID-19, the respondents may have an inclination towards a specific role of AI due to their limited exposure. Practical implications: Supply chain managers can utilise data to embed the required degree of resilience in their supply chains by considering the proposed framework elements and phases. Originality/value: The present research contributes a framework that presents a four-phased, structured and systematic platform considering the required information processing capabilities to recognise, analyse, reconfigure and activate phases to ensure supply chain resilience. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Equating data and information, the existing literature primarily focuses on the incentivisation behind information sharing between firms. The field of AI may bring a new way of looking at this problem by asking the following question: what if we do not share raw data but share learned information from it instead? This raises the next question, with whom and when should supply chain members share information, which we address in this paper. We develop a novel adaptive federated learning approach for the generation and usage of collective knowledge without direct data exchange and test the approach with a use case for collectively predicting supply risk. We propose a privacy-preserving network formation and clustering algorithm, which enables supply chain members to decide when to enter a collective information-sharing network, and how they should form information-sharing teams. Using data from an e-commerce platform, we illustrate how our approach outperforms the suppliers' own prediction models. We further show that clustering suppliers in teams achieves the best performance and converges faster compared to two benchmarks. The heterogeneity of information contribution by firms and those who benefit from collective information also raises important research questions on the role of cooperation in supply chains. © 2024 The Author(s).

Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of supply chains and developing the best mitigation plans for high-impact disruptions to enhance supply chain resilience is crucial to the survival of public and private organizations. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for diagnosing the vulnerability of suppliers, logistic providers, and commodities for any size of multi-tier supply chain networks for private and public bodies. The framework is based on a supply chain digital twin that will be formed with the industrial Internet of Things technology for accessing field data, machine learning models for disruption prediction, simulation methods for disruption scenario analysis, and optimization methods for developing mitigation plans to minimize the impact of anticipated disruptions. The framework also exploits a deep learning-based surrogate model of the digital supply chain twin. © The Author(s) 2026.

However, the task is not straightforward given the challenges, including that port safety is affected by multiple factors related to design, installation, operation and maintenance and that traditional risk assessment methods such as quantitative risk analysis cannot sufficiently address uncertainty in failure data. This paper develops an advanced Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach through incorporating Fuzzy Rule-Based Bayesian Networks (FRBN) to evaluate the criticality of the hazardous events (HEs) in a container terminal. The rational use of the Degrees of Belief (DoB) in a fuzzy rule base (FRB) facilitates the implementation of the new method in Container Terminal Risk Evaluation (CTRE) in practice. Compared to conventional FMEA methods, the new approach integrates FRB and BN in a complementary manner, in which the former provides a realistic and flexible way to describe input failure information while the latter allows easy updating of risk estimation results and facilitates real-time safety evaluation and dynamic risk-based decision support in container terminals. The proposed approach can also be tailored for wider application in other engineering and management systems, especially when instant risk ranking is required by the stakeholders to measure, predict and improve their system safety and reliability performance. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Biofuel can be utilized in engines without modification to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions and is a significant replacement for fossil fuels. Biodiesel can be produced from various inedible and edible biomass. Animal fat is a reasonable substitute among inedible resources due to its readily available and reasonably priced nature. Furthermore, the efficacy of the supply chain network at the strategic and tactical planning levels is compromised by risks of disruption due to labor strikes, natural disasters, operational downtime, and data uncertainty. This study proposes a robust possibilistic chance-constrained programming model for optimizing the animal fat-based biodiesel supply chain network under uncertainty. The model incorporates strategic and tactical planning decisions while accounting for potential disruptions and operational risks. The biodiesel smart manufacturing system reduces the amount of contaminants in the biodiesel with variable production rate, and an autonomation inspection system detects contaminants in the biodiesel. The biodiesel is purified in biorefineries after biodiesel natural manufacturing. The demand for biodiesel depends on the efficiency of awareness towards biodiesel and its selling price. To enhance resilience, the study introduces a p-robust algorithm that maximizes profitability under disruptive scenarios. A numerical example is analyzed, and the repercussions of the numerical example reveal that lower selling price and less awareness efficiency with more awareness expenditure and high selling price and awareness efficiency with less awareness expenditure increase the overall profit of the system. The findings of the designed model is valuable for policymakers to handle the uncertainty of a sustainable biodiesel supply chain network and biofuel production industry. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: To address the purpose of this study, a multimethod research approach is adopted as follows: first, data envelopment analysis (DEA) modelling and fuzzy set theory are used to build a fuzzy network DEA model to assess risk resilience of the overall supply chains and their individual tiers; next, the proposed model is tested using a survey of 150 middle- and top-level managers representing nine industry sectors in Iran. Findings: The survey results show a substantial variation in resilience ratings between the overall supply chains characterizing nine industry sectors in Iran and their individual tiers (upstream, downstream and organizational processes). The findings indicate that the system-wide characteristic of resilience of the overall supply chain is not necessarily indicative of the resilience of its individual tiers. Practical implications: High efficiency scores of a number of tiers forming a supply chain are shown to have only a limited effect on the overall efficiency score of the resulting supply chain. Overall, our research findings confirm the necessity of adopting both the system-wide and tier-specific approach by analysts and decision makers when assessing supply chain resilience. Integrated as part of risk response and mitigation process, the information obtained through such analytical approach ensures timely identification and mitigation of major sources of risk in the supply chains. Originality/value: Supply chain resilience assessment models rarely consider resilience to risks at the level of individual supply chain tiers, focusing instead on the system-wide characteristics of supply chain resilience. The proposed analytical model allows for the assessment of supply chain resilience among individual tiers for a wide range of supply chain risks categorized as upstream, downstream, organizational, network and external. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach was undertaken to address this novel pandemic situation. First, an open-ended structured questionnaire was developed, and data were collected from three neighbouring emerging economies: Pakistan, India and Iran. Experts' perspectives on vulnerabilities, response measures, resilience and restoration of supply chain activities, and the role of social capital were collected. Second, building upon the findings from phase one of the studies, a quantitative structured questionnaire using the supply chain operational reference (SCOR) model was used to collect data in a structured manner. This quantitative data were further analysed using frequency and contingency analysis. Findings: The findings from the first phase of the study inductively derive 36 resilience categories. Later, the contingency findings show that supply chain (SC) disruption is a major vulnerability for emerging economies, whereas solutions offered to combat it lay in the reconfiguration of resources, such as financial, technological, human, information and material. Additionally, supply network structure and social capital play an integral part in making SCs resilient against disruption. Research limitations/implications: The respondents comprise the academics/SC researchers, which make the findings interesting though they lack the industrial experts' perspectives, directly. Nevertheless, the propositions can be tested in industrial settings to see whether the results are limited to a specific industrial setting or are rather generalised. Practical implications: Similarly, practitioners and policy makers can incorporate the SCOR metrics/factors outlined in this study into their performance measurement systems and ensure continuous monitoring for firm's resilience. Originality/value: The study offers a holistic understanding of the developing regions' approaches to Covid-19. The paper also takes a social capital perspective to explain firms' resilience in these emerging economies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

With a focus on building robustness and adaptability, organizations need to opt for digital tools and strategies that can be harnessed to build more resilient supply chain networks. This research aims to explore the dynamics of adaptive risk management strategies and how those contribute toward digital supply chain resilience. The study delves into the integration of adaptive risk management practices into the digital supply chain system and analyzes the associated challenges. The impact of risk management strategies to foster digital supply chain resilience is vital across various sectors; however, the disruptions can be particularly profound in the manufacturing industry, where supply chains are highly globalized and complex. The manufacturing sector plays a key role in the UK's economy, and this study offers a unique opportunity to explore how digital technologies can enhance supply chain resilience, particularly in the aftermath of Brexit and a shift toward Industry 5.0 paradigm. The adoption of digital technologies, like artificial intelligence and big data analytics, is examined in this study identifying challenges, opportunities, and best practices. The collaboration and extent of engagement of key stakeholders are analyzed to identify the constraints in the process of integrating adaptive risk management practices into the supply chain of the UK manufacturing sector. The context of this research is highly relevant for the organizations seeking to develop more flexible and responsive risk management strategies to enhance the resilience in their supply chain system. The study will offer a roadmap to opt for more responsive risk management and integrate digital technologies into supply chain to enhance operational efficiency, effective risk handling and offer guidance in developing policies promoting the adoption of digital technologies and more transparent supply chain operations. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Many existing strategies to strengthen the resilience of supply chains are facilitated by the use of digital technology. Blockchain, as one of the promising innovative technologies, enables a transparent, secure, and timely data exchange and automation via smart contracts. In this paper, we discuss the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain risk management and, in particular, on supply chain resilience. We identify potential risk-related blockchain application scenarios and examine their impact on the existing resilience strategies. We explore the impact of the most promising applications with respect to resilience by using an agent-based simulation model of a complex supply network affected by disruptions. The theoretical analysis reveals a promotion of supply chain resilience strategies, especially if smart contracts are used for risk-related collaboration. The simulation study indicates an increase in resilience if the underlying collaboration is based on time-efficient processes: The propagation of disruptions, the network recovery time, and total costs can be substantially reduced. However, depending on the duration of the disruption, negative effects can occur if process efficiency is insufficient. From our investigations, we derive insights for managers who are interested in practical implementation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Using a case study of Thai automobile manufacturing, twelve critical RFs are identified through a comprehensive literature review and interpreted using the contingency resource-based view (CRBV), which emphasizes adaptive resource allocation and informed decision-making during crises. The Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) combined with single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS) is applied to examine complex causal relationships under uncertainty, while prominence values determine the relative importance of each factor. The top-ranked RFs include supplier relationship management, collaborative communication networks, contingency planning, emergency preparedness plans, risk assessment and monitoring, supply chain visibility, scenario planning, crisis leadership, cross-functional training, and supply chain redundancy. Relation analysis identifies five causal factors with positive influence values: crisis leadership, cross-functional training, collaborative communication networks, supplier relationship management, and risk assessment and monitoring. Seven RFs show negative influence values and are classified as effect factors: contingency planning, supply chain visibility, scenario planning, emergency preparedness plans, supplier evaluation, information technology integration, and supply chain redundancy, indicating their dependence on improvements in the causal factors. The findings support strategic resource prioritization, stronger disaster preparedness, and improved coordination across supply chain partners. The findings provide managerial guidance on strategic resource prioritization, capability development, and enhanced coordination across supply chain partners.

While several studies have explored the use of scale-free network models to design and optimise SC networks, there remains a lack of a generalised stress-testing method that can be applied to various types and sizes of SCs. To address this, we propose a novel approach to assess the resiliency of scale-free SC networks based on entropy measurements. By considering various sources of disruptions, including demand fluctuations, capacity constraints, and transportation disruptions, we create a stress test that measures the network's resiliency. Our method categorises the SC into plants, ports, and customers and analyses the impact of disruptions on individual nodes within similar categories. We utilise real-world SC logistics data and map it into a scale-free network representation. By calculating the global vulnerability of the entire SC network and the localised impact of node vulnerability, we gain insights into how disruptions propagate and affect interconnected nodes.

Evidence is gathered from available qualitative information sources concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 35 academic and non-academic sources were used for data analysis. These sources were analyzed to assess the interventions that are reported as being useful in the pandemic context for different supply chain networks. The analysis reports a current list of interventions and strategies corresponding to the three dimensions of the modified Haddon Matrix; (i) disaster phase (pre-event, response, and post-event), (ii) factors/actors involved in the disaster (supply chains, risk events, physical environment, and socio-cultural environment), and (iii) resilience components of agility, adaptability, and alignment. Overall, the findings showed that effective communication along the supply chain, pre-event risk management, strong relationships and higher coordination within the wider network community all play key roles in enhancing the overall resilience of supply chains against pandemics. This study proposes a third dimension (resilience components) to the extant Haddon Matrix and is hence, somewhat unique. This modified matrix offers managers and researchers a new tool to aid in a more thorough analysis and a deeper understanding of supply chain resilience. Piloting the modified matrix, this study also assesses reported intervention strategies thus helping supply chain managers to prepare, respond, and recover from disruptions caused by pandemics. © The Author(s) 2025."

This study aims to examine the causes, impacts and existing flood risk management measures in the Somali region of Ethiopia. The study used a mixed research methodology, including a cross-sectional survey, to collect original qualitative and quantitative data. In addition to flood risk and vulnerability assessment, the study evaluated urban flood risk management measures through soil protection service curve number, production distribution network and supply chain risk management methods.The results suggest that flooding in Dolo-Ado is increasing due to heavy rainfall and flooding, as well as inadequate flood control measures and geographical location. Soil Conservation Service Curve Number analysis shows that the arid landscape of Dolo-ado is predominantly shrub and barren with significant differences in land cover types. The low infiltration capacity, high runoff potential and frequent heavy rainfall are the main factors contributing to the area's high soil vulnerability to flash floodsConsequently, qualitative results also confirm that this has resulted in extensive infrastructure damage, displacement, loss of livelihoods, ecosystem disruption and disruption to community life, as well as water and health problems. In addition, flood risks are more severe for vulnerable urban communities, impacting services, the economy and the environment. Therefore, inadequate preventive measures for effective supply chain management are urgent and crucial for resilience. This study implies that urban planning and policies should be changed and prioritize the integration of production distribution networks and flood risk management in the supply chain to effectively mitigate floods. Climate change-responsive and integrated urban planning, improved drainage systems, early warning, emergency planning and community engagement are critical for flood preparedness, adaptation and resilience and require further research and modeling techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

Analyzing the occurrence and degree of vessel transportation delays under disaster conditions is one of the critical aspects of maritime transportation management. This article, based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, examined the real behavioral trajectories of vessels and delay characteristics during tropical cyclones. Taking the example of Tropical Cyclone Veronica, which occurred in the waters off northwestern Australia in 2019, we conducted a comprehensive analysis. This involved numerical simulations of the entire disaster process and the cleaning and matching of trajectory data for all affected vessels in the area. We delved deeply into the relationship between vessel behavior characteristics and tropical cyclones, identified factors contributing to delays, and, based on our findings, constructed a Bayesian network inference model for vessel transportation delays under disaster conditions. This model uses information such as tropical cyclone intensity, vessel basic attributes, behavior choices, and port disaster avoidance measures as its primary nodes. The research results indicate that vessel rerouting, vessel loss of control, and waiting for port entry are the three major sources of vessel delays during disasters. Key influencing factors contributing to these consequences include port closure measures, the duration of vessels being adversely affected by strong winds, vessel tendencies toward loss of control, and risk preferences. To control the extent of vessel delays more effectively, it is crucial to prioritize these sensitive factors and strengthen monitoring and management efforts. This model is driven by real data, providing an objective reflection of real-world scenarios, and its effectiveness has been validated through sensitivity analysis. The research perspective and algorithmic framework presented in this paper offer a novel paradigm and fresh perspective for the study of maritime transportation disasters. The research findings have significant implications for bolstering the resilience of maritime transportation networks, enhancing our comprehension and anticipation of delays, and ensuring the continuity, security, and efficiency of the global supply chain for goods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

Disruptive events often impede this flow due to confounding factors, which may not be identified immediately. The objective of this study is to assess supply chain risks by detecting significant risks, examining risk variations across different time phases and establishing risk sentiment relationships utilizing textual data. We examined two disruptive events—coronavirus disease 2019 (Omicron phase) and the Ukraine–Russia war—between November 2021 and April 2022. Data sources included news media and Twitter. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm was applied to the textual data to extract potential text-generated risks in the form of “topics.” A proportion of these risks were analyzed to assess their time-varying nature. Natural language processing-based sentiment analysis was applied to these risks to infer the sentiment coming from the media using the ordered probit model. The results identify various unnoticed risks, for example: logistics tension, supply chain resiliency, ripple effect, regional supply chain, etc. that may adversely affect supply chain operations if not considered. The outcomes also indicate that textual data sources are capable of capturing risks before the events actually occur. The outcomes further suggest that text data could be valuable for strategic decision making and improving supply chain visibility. © 2023, The Author(s).

The paper investigates the moderating effects of firm-level risk management strategies—detection, mitigation, and recovery—on the relationship between network structure and disruption risk, addressing a critical gap in understanding the interplay between network position and risk management effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: A network model of automotive product flows was constructed using secondary data, and risk management strategies were stochastically integrated from a scenario-based vignette experiment. An agent-based contagion simulation modeled disruption propagation throughout the network. Generalized least squares regression with random effects was then employed to analyze how network characteristics and risk management strategies influence disruption risk. Findings: The findings indicate a curvilinear relationship between network clustering and disruption risk, showing vulnerabilities at both extremely high and low levels of clustering. In contrast, centrality exhibited a predominantly linear relationship with disruption risk. Firm-level risk management strategies moderate these relationships differently, with detection and recovery strategies significantly attenuating the negative impacts of network vulnerabilities, while mitigation showed limited moderating effectiveness. Originality/value: This research contributes to supply chain risk management literature by empirically exploring how firm-level strategies interact with network-level constructs to shape disruption risk. It challenges existing assumptions about linear relationships in network theory, providing nuanced insights for practitioners on tailoring risk management based on network position. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The rise of online pharmacies has further expanded the market for counterfeit drugs, with over 50% of medicines sold online being fraudulent. These counterfeit drugs not only jeopardize the health and safety of individuals but also lead to significant revenue losses for legitimate pharmaceutical companies and substantial tax evasion costs for governments. Despite the implementation of various anti-counterfeiting strategies, many face challenges in ensuring reliable traceability, trust, and transparency regarding the origin of the drugs. Moreover, the lack of coordination between manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers exacerbates the problem, leading to ineffective drug recall systems and a pervasive lack of trust. Blockchain technology presents a promising solution to counterfeiting and theft in pharmaceutical supply chains. This study proposes and implements a blockchain-based solution for combating counterfeit medications in India’s pharmaceutical supply chains. The proposed approach includes controlling supply chain operations using several procedures embedded in smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as storing information using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), which improves scalability, reduces computing load, and allows for quick data retrieval with minimal processing. By leveraging homomorphic encryption (HE), regulatory authorities or auditors can securely validate that pharmaceuticals have followed the correct supply chain path while protecting sensitive information. The system’s scalability was determined by monitoring its performance as transaction volumes increased. The proposed system showed decreased latency and better throughput, indicating its suitability for application in real-world production environments. In addition to performance testing, the system’s security was assessed using Oyente, a static analysis tool for Solidity. This investigation verified the system’s security and resilience against possible flaws. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

This is very important in blockchain because it is necessary to secure, record, verify and share data with multiple parties to ensure transparency and trust. We introduce the advanced combining technology called blockchain-based NSGA III-GKM to achieve this. Genetic K-means clustering (GKM) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) are two advanced algorithms combined with the advanced blockchain technology used novelly to achieve this. Here, the novelty lies in using NSGA III for multi-objective optimization and GKM to improve clustering and identify meaningful patterns. Blockchain systems produce vast volumes of complex data; therefore, it is essential to identify meaningful patterns and trends. NSGA III and GKM solve these problems of blockchain. This study used NSGA III to solve problems with multiple objectives, such as improving trust, transparency and transport cost reduction. By using NSGA, the best solutions that can balance these challenging goals are effectively identified. At the same time, GKM improves the grouping process by fine-tuning the data points classified into similar clusters. This helps to identify the specific trends in blockchain-based supply chain data. By combining these methods, we can improve the trends and action mechanisms in e-commerce supply chains. These combined methods assist companies in identifying effective supply chain strategies, which help minimize risks and allow them to adapt to continuously changing blockchain systems. Real-world data from e-commerce supply chains were used to test the method’s efficacy. According to the findings, a balance was successfully shown between various goals and provided suggestions for improving supply chain networks driven by blockchain. Overall, by combining blockchain with NSGA III and GKM, it not only ensures security and trust but also leverages advanced analytics to improve transparency and operational efficiency. Therefore, it will help organizations to achieve resilient and efficient supply chain management. © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company."

The author follows a four-layer architecture—Data Ingestion, Blockchain Network, Smart Contract, and Application—that provides secure, verifiable sharing of information. With IBM Food Trust and Kaggle datasets on U.K. retail, and with scenario-driven simulations, the model showed improved results by 14-fold in time resolving disputes, 480-fold in recall efficiency, and 70% in consumer trust index relative to the traditional systems. Proactive risk detection was further allowed via anomaly detection techniques developed against smart contract logs, such as isolation forest and one-class support vector machine. Although the study still has limitations in the scope of the dataset and the cost of implementation, it does provide theoretical and practical knowledge on the ability of blockchain to develop resilient and transparent supply chains. © 2025 IGI Global.

Though some potential benefits of the KG have been identified, there is still little work on implementing the KG in supply chain risk management (SCRM). This study develops a KG-based risk management framework to improve the resilience of Supply Chains (SCs). Specifically, the construction of the SC knowledge graph (SC-KG) framework, including the implementation steps, is presented in detail for the purpose of SC knowledge retrieval, data visualization analysis, risk monitoring, early warning, and decision support. Furthermore, the SC-KG is well constructed to build a scenario-based SCRM framework under consideration of the severity of disruptions. Especially during long-term disruptions, the continuity of SCs is maintained through the employment of a product change strategy and a structurally scalable and dynamically adapted network design method. The findings of the study are instructive for SC managers in adopting digital technologies for SC mitigation and recovery under disruptions. Finally, a practical SC-KG containing over 2.5 million entities and 11 types of relationships has been developed and its basic functions have been implemented, which contributes to improving the quality of SC management. © 2014 IEEE.

In 2012, both services experienced potentially catastrophic challenges to key assets. NHSBT suffered a flood that closed the largest blood-manufacturing centre in Europe, whilst ARCBS experienced the failure of a data centre network switch that rendered the national blood management system inaccessible for 42 h. This paper describes both crisis events, including the immediate actions, recovery procedures and lessons learned. Materials and Methods: Both incidents triggered emergency response plans. These included hospital reprovisioning and recovery from the incident. Once normal services had been restored, both events were subjected to root cause analysis (RCA) and production of 'lessons learned' reports. Results: In both scenarios, the key enablers of rapid recovery were established emergency plans, clear leadership and the support of a flexible workforce. Product issues to hospitals were unaffected, and there were no abnormal trends in hospital complaints. RCA identified the importance of risk mitigations that require co-operation with external organizations. Reviews of both events identified opportunities to enhance business resilience through prior identification of external risks and improvements to contingency plans, for example by implementing mass messaging to staff and other stakeholders. Conclusions: Blood establishment emergency plans tend to focus on responding to mass casualty events. However, consolidation of manufacturing to fewer sites combined with a reliance on national IT systems increases the impact of loss of function. Blood services should develop business continuity plans which include prevention of such losses, and the maintenance of services and disaster recovery. © 2015 International Society of Blood Transfusion.

This study selects 46 listed companies in the NEV supply chain (2019–2023) as samples, innovatively integrating multi-source data including financial metrics, textual tone analysis of annual reports, and ESG ratings. A three-dimensional composite indicator system (“financial robustness–strategic credibility–environmental resilience”) is developed to compare the predictive performance of Logit models and backpropagation (BP) neural networks in estimating corporate default probabilities. Empirical findings reveal: (1) Under the composite indicator system, the BP neural network achieves 81.7% default prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming the Logit model (72.4%), with a 32-percentage-point improvement in identifying defaulted entities; (2) Using single financial indicators, the BP network maintains superiority (58.3% overall accuracy vs 48.3% for Logit), validating its capacity to capture complex risk features; (3) The composite system enhances prediction accuracy by 23.4% (BP) and 24.1% (Logit) compared to single indicators, demonstrating the early-warning value of non-financial metrics. These results suggest that the synergistic application of multi-source composite indicators and BP neural networks substantially improves the precision of dynamic credit risk assessment in the NEV sector, offering methodological support for differentiated financial services and regulatory oversight. © The Author(s) 2025"

This threat is amplified because of global distributed SC networks, increased access to the Internet and challenging economic conditions. Research purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore risk mitigation capabilities and SC resilience (SCRES) to reduce the effects of counterfeiting in the South African pharmaceutical industry. Motivation for the study: Developing countries such as South Africa tend to be more vulnerable to counterfeiting, as these countries do not have established responses that are seen in more developed countries, such as SC regulation, track-and-trace technology and enforcement regimes. Research design, approach and method: This study employed a generic qualitative research design. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 12 pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and retailers in the South African pharmaceutical industry. A thematic analysis approach was followed to analyse the collected data. Main findings: The findings show that the sources of counterfeiting stem from the local and outsourced manufacturing of counterfeited products, presence of unauthorised distributors and importing of counterfeit products. Risk awareness can be enhanced by collaborating with industry members, training members to identify counterfeits and by developing authentication technologies. The industry actively combats counterfeiting by using SCRES enablers including visibility, collaboration, information sharing and by developing an SC risk management culture. Practical/managerial implications: South African pharmaceutical firms have limited resilience. Therefore, managers should develop flexibility, agility, sensing and redundancy as resilience enables firms to combat counterfeiting. Contribution/value-add: This study expands the current literature by identifying the unique sources of counterfeiting and risk mitigation capabilities to combat counterfeiting in pharmaceutical firms in a developing country context. © 2021.

However, this reliance has also swelled the attack surface, rendering supply chains a prime target for evildoers. Meanwhile, the inherent complexity of supply chain ecosystems prevents defenders from fully applying contemporary security controls promptly and effectively. Clearly, the combination of these hindering factors has led to some of the most severe cybersecurity incidents of the past years. This study is the first to our knowledge that undertakes a comprehensive technical analysis of reported supply chain security incidents. Our analysis is done both from offensive and defensive prisms, leveraging well-established cybersecurity frameworks and guidelines, namely, the ATT&CK MITRE knowledge base matrix and the NIST SP 800-161, respectively. Furthermore, to consolidate our findings and facilitate future research initiatives, we compiled a fundamental dataset that can be used as the basis for automated analysis and potential integration with cybersecurity workflows. The key observations of a 33-incident analysis through the lens of an ATT&CK MITRE- and NIST SP 800-161-based taxonomies we propose can be wrapped up into two key points. First, the attack surface continues to expand, following an upward spiral due to the mushrooming of tactics and techniques that can facilitate the early or late stages of attacks, highlighting their complexity, sophistication, and widespread impact. Second, our findings underscore the necessity of a multifaceted approach to strengthening supply chain resilience. This includes implementing robust cybersecurity controls, comprehensive risk assessment methodologies, and transparent collaboration among suppliers, customers, and vendors to ensure adherence to state-of-the-art cybersecurity best practices. © 2025 The Authors

Without the need for a central body, blockchain technology allows for a transparent and distributed setting. One of the fields where blockchain is considered to hold a lot of promise is healthcare. Data analysis, which has the potential to merge disparate networks and increase Electronic Health Record (EHR) accuracy, should be prioritised in order to transform healthcare. Blockchain technologies can help with access management, data sharing, and maintaining an audit trail of medical operations. It may also be used to help with opioid prescribing and supply chain management, as well as risk data identification, access monitoring, data storage, and the management of a patient audit trail. The healthcare system is changing to allow for a more patient-centred approach. The healthcare networks based on the blockchain may increase security and resiliency by giving patients control of their data. The biggest problems with prescription protection in the illicit medicine supply chain are related to how the medicines are made in the first place. Since tracing the correct and active pharmaceutical ingredients during actual manufacturing is complex, identifying medications that do not include the expected active ingredients can result in patient injury or death. Blockchain’s unique features enable it to provide a basis for full medication tracking through origin till end customer, and the ability to detect fake medications. This chapter covers the introduction to blockchain technology, its background concepts, and importance of blockchain in the domain of healthcare. A framework for the medical supply chain using blockchain has been proposed. The chapter concludes with various research challenges in the domain of blockchain medical supply chain along with the case study. © 2022 CRC Press.

However, SC firms still lack transparency and accuracy in SC networks and work under high-risk conditions. In this direction, a cyber-physical fusion architecture is proposed to gain interoperability and technical integration between the cyber and physical worlds, resulting in a resilient SC. The core components of the architecture include a cyber-physical production system (CPPS), big data, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), additive manufacturing (AM), and incorporation of blockchain technology (BCT), which provide a realistic solution for traditional SC models to mitigate risk. This study highlights the proposed cyber-physical fusion architecture that can lead to SC innovation and reconfiguration in the digital era. The objective of this study is to explore the potential opportunities of the proposed architecture through which SC performance can be enhanced by capturing real-time data, SC risks, disruptions, product visualization, or logistic tracking that can be accessed by edge services or portable terminals. It is underlined that adopting the proposed architecture will synchronize and resilient the SC and provide many provisions for cost reductions, controlled carbon emissions, and optimal usage of resources to mitigate risk.

However, this transformation also presents significant cybersecurity challenges, necessitating the adoption of robust security frameworks to safeguard sensitive health information and AI-driven systems. This paper explores key cybersecurity standards that play a crucial role in securing AI-based healthcare networks. This chapter begins with an overview of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its impact on patient privacy and health data security. It then examines the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, including NIST Special Publication 800-53, which provides guidelines for protecting information systems in healthcare. Additionally, the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) and ISO 27001 are analyzed for their relevance in ensuring comprehensive information security in healthcare settings. Given the increasing importance of global data protection laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also discussed in relation to its implications for AI-powered healthcare networks. The paper further explores cybersecurity best practices, vendor and supply chain security, and medical device security—particularly through compliance with IEC 62304 and AAMI TIR57 standards. As AI-specific risks continue to emerge, the document delves into AI-specific security measures, including adversarial attack mitigation, model explainability, and continuous security assessments. Furthermore, essential elements such as secure data handling, incident response planning, continuous monitoring, and threat detection are evaluated to establish a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. This chapter highlights the challenges and future directions in implementing these standards, offering insights into strengthening the resilience of AI-driven healthcare networks. By integrating these frameworks and best practices, organizations can ensure the security, compliance, and integrity of AI-powered healthcare ecosystems while mitigating cyber threats. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

In seismically active areas like Italy, earthquakes can compromise road infrastructure, leading to structural failures and connectivity disruptions. Bridges, vital for travel and emergency response, are especially vulnerable to these extreme events, making their maintenance and recovery crucial for preserving transport efficiency. This study examines the resilience of the Apulian road network against bridge failures by assessing seismic hazards, the structural vulnerability of each bridge to seismic actions, and the systemic consequences of its disruption. A bridge criticality score is defined to support data-driven decision-making for bridge maintenance and recovery. This novel quantitative metric integrates seismic hazard data at each bridge site, fragility curves, and topological complex network analysis to provide a comprehensive evaluation of bridge criticality. Additionally, the risk of isolation for inner municipalities due to bridge disruptions is assessed using centrality metrics. By combining the bridge criticality score with an emphasis on inner municipalities, this approach offers valuable insights to improve road network resilience, mitigate isolation risks, and promote territorial sustainability in earthquake-prone zones. © 2025 Kheirkhahan et al.

Within this dynamic process, the load redistribution behaviour is the core countermeasure for the propagation of cascading failures, however the diversified mechanism has not been systematically studied. To fill in these gaps, this study aims to develop a pioneering resilience analysis framework against cascading failures, to comprehensively explore the impact of port disruptions on the shipping network resilience. By pioneering the influence analysis of port betweenness, weight, and connectivity on load determination and target selection, a port importance assessment method is applied as the foundation for load redistribution decisions. Based on the global service routes data from 2020 to 2023, the GCSN resilience against the sequential cascading failures of 686 ports worldwide is quantified by three metrics. A scenario analysis is conducted to simulate the effects of cascading failures triggered by 5 historical port disruption events (e.g., the COVID-19 port lockdowns and the 2024 bridge collision at Baltimore port) on resilience of the network. Determining the identified critical capacity threshold is pivotal for effectively enhancing the system's resilience and preventing the likelihood of cascading failures. Additionally, this study offers cutting-edge perspectives to the global shipping industry stakeholders. It presents distinct strategies and preferences, offering actionable advice for port authorities in their risk response decisions. Moreover, this study delivers an economic rationale and critical evaluations, instrumental for the strategic maintenance, planning and augmentation of port infrastructures to prevent unforeseen risks. © 2024 The Author(s)

This crisis was further exacerbated by trade bans imposed on another major global wheat exporter. Since wheat production and export are intrinsically linked, particularly in times of crisis, it is essential to adopt the concept of an intertwined supply chain. Accordingly, this study proposes an intertwined supply chain framework for the production and export of wheat during long-term disruptions. To enhance the viability of this intertwined system, the study introduces three key strategies. First, it addresses long-term disruptions and operational risks by employing redundancies and data-driven robust optimization techniques, where uncertainty sets are generated using a support vector clustering model. Second, the proposed supply chain accounts for freshwater resource limitations by integrating water resilience measures. Third, as the framework operates within a global context, it incorporates a comprehensive model that considers exchange rates, taxation, foreign demand points, and international trade responsibilities. To optimize these strategies, two multi-objective optimization models are developed and solved using an epsilon-constraint method. A cardinality-based measure is introduced to efficiently represent the Pareto front, offering decision-makers valuable insights into non-dominated solutions. The results are divided into analyses of wheat production, export, and their combined network. Individual analyses assess network setup, viability, and uncertainty control, while the integrated analysis examines sensitivity and interdependence. Overall, improving water use, managing risks, and designing a resilient, interconnected system can greatly strengthen the wheat supply chain during long-term crises. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

However, data limitations imposed by industry sensitivity and competition have hindered research in this area. Combining big data and complex network theory, this study introduces an Open Supplier Knowledge Extraction and Complement (OSKEC) approach, incorporating cross-domain named entity recognition, firm entity fuzzy matching, and supplier relation inferring, to construct highly reliable supply chain networks from limited information. Applying OSKEC on the Chinese automotive Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) industry approves its effectiveness in enhancing supply chain visibility and resilience. Topological analysis for the built supply chain network reveals a clear scale-free degree distribution, implying a strong heterogeneity for the interdependence of entities in the network. Specifically, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Mobileye occupy the majority share of the automotive SoC market in China, while local enterprises only hold a smaller portion. We further develop two interaction disruption models (IDMs) which simulate the impact of various disturbances on firms with different recovery capacities and risk-transfer strategies, and find that a risk-transfer enterprise strategy may lead to a rapid collapse of the network in the early stages of disruptions. In general, the study improves the understanding of modern supply chain dynamics and inform effective risk management strategies in the Chinese automotive SoC sector. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

Methods: This study constructs a multimodal transport route optimization model under uncertainty with the objective of the sum of transportation cost, transshipment cost, penalty cost and carbon emission cost. To enhance the computational efficiency of the model, a novel invasive weed optimization with memory and encoding value clustering capabilities is proposed. In addition, by fusing the Q-learning algorithm in reinforcement learning with the novel invasive weed algorithm, the action-value function table obtained from the training facilitates the selection of optimal routes. Based on empirical data, explore the sensitivity analysis of node disruptions, time windows, and fuzzy demand on route decision-making under public health emergencies. Results: The transport network is affected by public health emergencies, which makes the optimal route deviate from the expected goal, resulting in an increase in the total cost. The proportion of total cost is determined by the position of nodes in the network, with critical nodes suffering more losses than ordinary nodes. Reasonable setting of time windows and fuzzy demand intervals is an effective way to improve the resilience and transportation efficiency of multimodal transport network. Conclusions: This study provides more applicable decision-making references for enterprises to prevent the risk of supply chain disruptions caused by public health emergencies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

Conventional practices of supply chain management (SCM) cannot overcome real-time uncertainties, and it is time to orient the SCM toward AI-guided predictive modeling. This research contains a suggestion of a deep learning (DL) framework that combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict more accurately the supply chain shipping timing and delivery risk. Applying the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset, the offered SOM+ANN model proved much more accurate than conventional Machine Learning (ML) procedures, e.g., Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, or Decision Tree (DT), to address the tasks of predicting the shipping time and categorizing the risk of late delivery. The R2 was found to be 0.92, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 0.936, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 0.8459 of the SOM+ANN model estimated the shipping duration. In the classification, the accuracy was 96% and the F1-score was 96.22%. Furthermore, the research also employed another dataset, making it more accurate, better generalized, and robust. The proposed model achieved 89.65% accuracy in dataset 2. The model’s outcomes are also interpretable and assisted by SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations). The interpretability methods enabled end users to comprehend how the model makes classification decisions. The proposed framework promotes SCM operations, resilience, and decision-making by incorporating transparent AI methodologies. © The Author(s) 2025.

While solar installations across globe increase, critical solar manufacturing remains highly concentrated in China. This creates reliance on imports and exposes India's vulnerability to the supply chain. Despite India's ambitious target to achieve 500GW of renewable capacity by 2030, its dependence on imported solar modules, cells, unavailability of wafers, and polysilicon manufacturing raises concerns over self-reliance and long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, Deep Localization (DL) framework that extends conventional localization framework by fostering innovation, circular economy practices, building trust, and a resilient domestic supply chain. The variables were identified through a literature review and expert inputs. Exploratory Factor Analysis was applied to determine the factor structure and eliminate weak variables. A hypothesized model was developed to analyze the interplay between policy, risk, and demand management, DL, and their impact on supplier and manufacturer development in India's solar PV sector. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire survey from 411 respondents, and the model was validated using Structural Equation Modelling. The findings highlight that policy management is essential for risk mitigation. The integrated policy, demand and risk management create an enabling environment for DL, with a strong focus on creating a robust supplier-manufacturer network to enhance competitiveness. By adopting DL strategies, India can transition from an import driven country to a global manufacturing hub, ensuring India's ambitions for economic growth, sustainability, and energy security. © 2025 International Energy Initiative

Aiming at this problem, a two-stage distributionally robust optimisation model based on data-driven is established to design a closed-loop supply chain network that can be flexibly executed in case of disruption. To analyse the resilience of the supply chain, the model considers the possible random disruptions of two types of facilities, and aims to deal with them through active and passive strategies such as supplier fortifying, recovery, signing with backup suppliers, and lateral transshipment. In addition, in view of the uncertainty of disruption scenarios and the limited disruption historical data available, distributionally robust optimisation method with the Wasserstein ambiguity set is used. In solving, the established robust model is transformed into a tractable model form using duality and linearisation technology, and solved by Gurobi solver. The numerical results show: Considering resilient measures effectively mitigate disruption hazards; Adding the recycling strategy can significantly reduce the production costs; Comparing with stochastic and classical robust optimisation models, the performance of the model established in this paper is highlighted. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Real data is used as input to the models to create and five alternative SC designs which can be implemented depending on the current risks to the humanitarian SC. This constitutes the new concept of design redundancy, whereby humanitarian SC managers can analyse multiple alternative SC designs for humanitarian operations.

In many developing countries, the coal industry plays a leading role in electric power generation and primarily contributes to carbon emissions. This study aims to design a resilient and green coal supply chain network (RG-CSCN) considering strategic-level disruptions, operational-level risks, and carbon emissions. A practical stochastic mixed-integer programming model is developed to optimise both economic and environmental objectives (i.e., the total network cost and the total carbon emissions cost). Our proposed model involves five resilience strategies: facility fortification, reserving emergency inventory, direct-to-port delivery, establishing reliable distribution centres, and multiple transportation routes. Based on real-world data from the coal industry, we conduct extensive computational experiments to evaluate the impacts of strategic-level disruptions and operational-level risks and to validate the applicability of the proposed five resilience strategies and their synergistic performance in coal supply chain management. Moreover, sensitivity analyses are carried out to examine the influences of different customer service levels and carbon tax policies in various scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

This paper presents a novel optimization approach for designing and planning a resilient and sustainable supply chain for bioethanol production, utilizing second and third-generation biomass. The proposed approach adeptly determines crucial strategic and tactical decisions for the supply chain while effectively addressing epistemic uncertainties and disruption risks associated with the production process. These decisions, encompassing optimal locations, capacities, technologies, production, distribution, and transportation choices, are strategically navigated in three distinct phases. In the first phase, a combined data envelopment analysis and artificial neural network approach selects optimal sites for establishing microalgae production facilities. The second phase presents a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the bioethanol supply chain design by minimizing total costs and meeting sustainability constraints on greenhouse gas emissions and employment. The model seamlessly integrates multiple biomass feedstocks, incorporating wheat straw, corn stover, and microalgae. Addressing disruption risks, the third phase employs a novel robust stochastic-possibilistic programming to effectively tackle uncertainties in costs, prices, and yields. The implementation of the proposed optimization approach using real data from a case study demonstrates its utility as a decision support tool for resilient and sustainable bioethanol supply chain design. Computational results notably highlight the superiority of the proposed robust approach, showcasing over 11 % cost savings compared to its deterministic counterpart. © 2024

Structured across three strategic phases: foundation, expansion, and maturation, the model facilitates the systematic phase-out of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by 2045 and natural gas (NG) by 2080. Employing demand estimation methodologies grounded in historical data and exponential decay functions, the study forecasts long-term hydrogen adoption trajectories and allocates regional demand to optimise infrastructure placement. A network optimisation model identifies the optimal locations and capacities of national, regional, and local distribution centres (NDCs, RDCs, and LDCs). This staged development ensures operational scalability, geographic equity, and financial viability. A key finding is the substantial increase in profitability from $479 million in 2026 to $88.26 billion by 2090, driven by infrastructure growth and increasing hydrogen demand. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the adoption during the mid years (2040–2060) is particularly vulnerable to cost fluctuations. The model supports net-zero 2050 goals and aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDGs 7, 9, and 13. While the HHSC provides a structured pathway for long-term hydrogen transition, future research should focus on enhancing the resilience of the HHSC by incorporating real-time data integration, assessing vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, and developing risk mitigation strategies to ensure continuity and scalability in hydrogen delivery under uncertain operating conditions. © 2025 The Authors.

Significant research has been conducted designing efficient supply chains and recent research has focused on resilient supply chain design. However, the integration of resilient and robust supply chain design is less well studied. The purpose of the paper is to include resilience and robustness into supply chain design. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a method to include resilience and robustness into supply chain design. Using the region of West Africa, which is plagued with persisting logistical issues, the authors develop a regional risk assessment framework and then apply categorical risk to the countries of West Africa using publicly available data. A scenario reduction technique is used to focus on the highest risk scenarios for the model to be tractable. Next, the authors develop a mathematical model leveraging this framework to design a resilient supply network that minimizes cost while ensuring the network functions following a disruption. Finally, the authors examine the network's robustness to demand uncertainty via several plausible emergency scenarios. Findings: The authors provide optimal sets of transshipment hubs with varying counts from 5 through 15 hubs. The authors determine there is no feasible solution that uses only five transshipment hubs. The authors' findings reinforce those seven transshipment hubs – the solution currently employed in West Africa – is the cheapest architecture to achieve resilience and robustness. Additionally, for each set of feasibility transshipment hubs, the authors provide connections between hubs and demand spokes.

Existing literature focuses on modelling operational SCR, emphasising post-disruption impact and recovery, but lacks practical tools and metrics for assessing resilience from a strategic perspective. Strategic decisions, such as supply network design and strategy for selecting suppliers, are critical to mitigate disruption risks and impacts. To address this gap, we propose a supply chain strategic resiliency index (SRI) to comprehensively measure strategic SCR. The index integrates the consideration of supply network structure, supplier reliability (especially geopolitical risks), and each supplier’s contribution of material flow into a unified metric. Such an index can serve three primary purposes: (1) benchmarking the resilience of the existing supply chain, (2) evaluating the impact of strategic supply chain management decisions, and (3) assessing the resilience impact of new technology developments. As a use case, we analyzed the lithium supply chain of U.S. electric vehicle manufacturers, utilising real-world lithium imports and vehicle production data. Our results show that automakers are increasing their SCR, as exemplified by General Motors’ SRI increase from 27 in 2022 to 59 in 2023, and further to 65 in 2024. © 2025 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Monthly operational data, including data from 441 suppliers, were collected from a Chinese e-commerce platform, with their extended supply networks constructed using binary relationship data obtained from TianYanCha. Fixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Findings: The results indicate that suppliers’ structural holes in the extended supply network improve supply chain resilience, whereas network centrality and spatial complexity are negatively associated with it. Furthermore, the speed of suppliers’ operational processes not only enhances supply chain resilience but also mitigates the negative impact of network centrality and weakens the positive impact of structural holes while strengthening the negative impact of spatial complexity. Practical implications: E-commerce platforms can increase supply chain resilience by strategically leveraging suppliers’ network positions and operational capabilities. Platforms should leverage structural holes for diverse resources, mitigate risks from centralized suppliers through diversification and invest in technologies for visibility. Balancing the speed of processes with visibility and coordination helps mitigate disruptions. Originality/value: These findings provide empirical evidence on the joint effects of a supplier’s position and its operational capabilities on supply chain resilience, enhancing the current understanding of the antecedents of supply chain resilience from a supply network perspective. It offers insights into how platforms leverage suppliers’ positions in extended supply networks and operational capabilities to bolster supply chain resilience during disruptions. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

DSCS has potential applications in risk management, supplier performance management, production planning, inventory optimization, quality management, supplier financing, and cost reduction in supply chains. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is potentially a key enabler and may facilitate a step change in DSCS. We present a framework, SDAR (Surveillance, Detection, Action, Response), to support the design of effective business processes for supply network surveillance. We outline the most important types of AI algorithms and models and discuss their applicability to a range of questions that arise in DSCS. By linking different surveillance data sources and systems, appropriate AI techniques can make surveillance easier, more informative, and scalable. However, AI-based DSCS gives rise to significant technical, ethical, and managerial challenges. These include the decomposition and reintegration of surveillance data and analyses, data imbalances, mitigation of biases in data, algorithms and statistical estimations, and the challenge of embedding DSCS in effective supplier monitoring and auditing processes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, a large number of risks impact the operation of supply chains. Those actual and potential risks should be efficiently and effectively monitored and managed by supply chain management. Toward the achievement of these targets, the implementation of a well-organized risk management system, the achievement of a high level of integration between supply chain members, and the quick and effective information circulation and dissemination through the extended use of novel digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain and others, are vital. These three concepts are interrelated, and their successful implementation positively influences the supply chain’s risk minimization and operational performance. Grouping risks and developing the appropriate mitigation strategies are essential to identify and keeping risks under control and achieving resilience. In particular, the relevant literature suggests various groups and sub-groups of risks; endogenous/internal and exogenous/external risks are the main categories, and multiple sourcing, high flexibility, and strong collaboration between partners are the most common mitigation strategies. Moreover, emphasis on sustainable objectives and sustainability-related risks is needed. Supply chain operators based on collected and analyzed data with the assistance of new digital technologies and the implementation of the proper management system can successfully manage future risks.

Through the use of cutting-edge technology and cooperative structures, this abstract lays out a plan to construct a supply chain of the future that is marked by openness, accountability, and longevity. Embedded in this revolution is the idea of enabling transparent supply, which comprises utilizing new technologies like blockchain, IoT, and AI to build a supply chain network that is both efficient and open to scrutiny. The underlying infrastructure for allowing transparent supply is provided by blockchain technology, which has an immutable and decentralized ledger. From the procurement of raw materials to the delivery of finished items to the customer, blockchain technology records every transaction and movement of commodities on a distributed ledger, making the whole supply chain transparent and traceable. Internet of Things (IoT) device integration improves supply chain visibility and real-time tracking even further. In order to facilitate proactive decision-making and risk management, stakeholders may install sensors and networked devices at several touchpoints to track critical variables like location, humidity, and temperature. Optimizing supply chain processes and improving transparency are two areas where artificial intelligence plays a crucial role. Organizations can now better anticipate demand variations, optimize inventory levels, and minimize supply chain risks with the use of AI-driven analytics, which provide predictive insights and prescriptive suggestions. To construct a supply chain fit for the future, technical advancements are not enough; stakeholder participation and partnership development are equally crucial. By fostering open communication and exchange of data, collaborative platforms and consortiums make it possible to integrate previously siloed supply chain systems in a streamlined fashion. For the supply chain ecosystem to remain viable and resilient in the long run, it is crucial to include sustainability principles. Organizations may improve their social impact, decrease their carbon footprint, and boost their brand image by making supply chain decisions based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. © 2025 Scrivener Publishing LLC."

We started by framing resilience in measurable terms, focusing on key performance indicators such as on-time delivery, cost efficiency, and variability across carriers and regions. With these metrics in place, the next step was to clean and structure shipment data so that patterns could be revealed. Using that foundation, we built models to predict delays, optimize carrier selection, and detect anomalies that might signal underlying fragility. Forecasting methods were applied to anticipate future shipping costs and route performance, while clustering was used to distinguish between resilient and fragile connections within the network. From there, we moved beyond standard predictive tasks. We experimented with resilience-aware objectives that penalize misclassifying delayed shipments more heavily, tested whether models trained in one region could adapt to another, and subjected the models to stress scenarios that mimicked shocks like surges in demand, noisy data, or carrier disruptions. What stood out is that while traditional metrics and models capture average performance well, resilience-aware methods provide a sharper view of vulnerabilities and recovery capacity. The insights are not just academic. They show that resilience can be operationalized through a combined framework of analytics and machine learning, producing tools that managers and policymakers can use to spot risks earlier, choose more reliable carriers, and plan for disruption. In practice, this makes it possible to see resilience as more than a buzzword: it becomes a measurable, actionable quality of the supply chain that can be managed and improved across U.S. regions. © 2025, Diogenes Co.

Conventional methods aim to address the complexities of modern supply chains, promoting the transition to intelligent and data-driven strategies. Methods: This research represents an innovative methodology for predicting the risk of late deliveries in supply chains. The presented framework combines clustering and multiclassification techniques, where the clustering phase is executed through hyperparameter optimization and a novel metaheuristic called RIME. In the multiclassification phase, five distinct deep learning models are employed, namely, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), within Ensemble learning via bagging, Ensemble learning stacking, and Ensemble learning within boosting. The three ensemble learning models are based in GAN and CNN-LSTM. Result: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of diverse models in a risk of late delivery prediction framework. This evaluation demonstrates that Ensemble learning stacking provides the higher accuracy by 0.926, showcasing its prowess in precise predictions. Notably, Ensemble learning bagging and Ensemble learning boosting exhibit strong precision. Regression metrics reveal Ensemble learning stacking and Ensemble learning bagging's superior error minimization (MSE 0.11, MAE 0.09). This metric demonstrates that the proposed model can predict the risk level of late delivery in a supply chain with high precision. Conclusion: This paper introduces an innovative clustering and multiclassification-based framework for predicting the risk of late deliveries.

This research utilizes data of China's A-share listed agricultural companies from 2009 to 2023, employing text analysis to develop supply chain financial indicators. Empirical findings indicate that supply chain finance enhances resilience by enhancing enterprises' business credit capability and reducing supply chain disruption risks. Mechanisms, including liquidity injection, risk-sharing, and digital traceability, empower enterprises to stabilize operations amid disturbances, invest in climate-resilient technology, and optimize resource allocation. Heterogeneous effects highlight contextual differences: Non-state-owned firms, functioning under strict credit restrictions, gain larger resilience benefits than state-owned enterprises dependent on institutional support. Likewise, locations with sophisticated financial ecosystems enhance the influence of supply chain financing via digital integration, whereas underdeveloped sectors encounter structural inefficiencies.

The authors aim to explore how three dimensions of social capital (cognitive, structural and relational) may act as facilitators or enablers of the four formative capabilities for SCRES (i.e. flexibility, velocity, visibility, and collaboration), identified by Jüttner and Maklan. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from three separate tiers of the supply chain involved in the response to an extreme event (the Lambrigg, UK rail crash). Using a social constructionist approach, the paper explores how social capital may enable the emergence of formative capabilities for resilience. Findings: The data suggest that the dimensions of social capital may play an influential role in facilitating the four formative capabilities for SCRES and indicate the potential for these to be mutually reinforcing. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides an illustration of some links between resilience and social capital constructs within one supply network, in the context of crisis response. Different types of network and contexts may result in other outcomes and have other facilitating effects upon SCRES. These findings should be explored within other contexts. Practical implications: The authors highlight that social capital may be nurtured deliberately or emerge as a consequence of relationships within a network. Formal efforts to build network communications, norms of reciprocity may create the conditions for appropriable organisations to emerge when faced with extreme events. Originality/value: Drawing from a social capital perspective, this paper contributes to a fuller understanding of notions of relational capital. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

To validate, centralized federated learning with horizontal data was applied for delivery delay prediction using datasets from two textile suppliers: supplier 1 has less data and is considered small, while supplier 2, with more data, represents a larger one. The prediction model is developed using an artificial neural network within the federated framework. The results show that federated learning benefits suppliers, especially the ones with limited data. Notably, federated learning outperforms centralized learning and local standalone learning. This highlights its potential to address privacy and facilitate collaboration. © 2025 by the authors.

A significant advantage of such digitization is the facilitation of personalized and agile manufacturing processes. However, this interconnectedness introduces a spectrum of novel threat vectors, enabling sophisticated Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. One critical vulnerability lies in the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes. These IoT devices, now extensively utilized for sensing, data acquisition, analysis, and communication within manufacturing environments, have concomitantly escalated the risk of cyber threats. To counteract these threats, advanced intrusion detection systems leveraging deep learning algorithms have emerged as scalable and intelligent solutions for safeguarding industrial IoT and WSN infrastructures. This paper introduces a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model tailored for cybersecurity attack detection in industrial IoT environments, specifically within WSN-based smart manufacturing contexts. The proposed CNN-LSTM model exhibits superior efficacy in identifying DDoS attacks within Industry 5.0 CPS environments, surpassing conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilizing real-world network traffic datasets, the developed deep learning-based network anomaly detection system enhances the capability to detect and mitigate cyber threats, thereby reinforcing the security and resilience of smart manufacturing systems. The practical benefits of this enhanced cyberattack detection system include improved operational reliability, reduced downtime, and the protection of critical assets in real-world smart manufacturing settings. © 2020 IEEE.

Traditional approaches often struggle to balance data privacy, cross-organizational collaboration, and real-time adaptability. While distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) initially enabled cryptocurrencies, they have evolved into a foundational infrastructure for decentralized AI applications. This study investigates how decentralized AI techniques, particularly federated learning, can support joint risk management processes in enterprise networks. First, a comprehensive review of decentralized AI methods is conducted to identify approaches suitable for enterprise risk management. Next, expert interviews are used to contextualize these insights, highlighting practical considerations, organizational challenges, and adoption constraints. Building on the literature and expert feedback, a decentralized framework is developed to allow organizations to securely share risk-related insights while preserving data privacy and control over proprietary information. The framework is validated through a technical prototype, combining architectural design with empirical proof-of-concept experiments on federated learning benchmarks. Results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving near-centralized model accuracy under privacy constraints, while also highlighting communication and governance issues that need to be addressed in real-world deployments. The study presents a structured comparison of decentralized AI techniques and a validated concept for enhancing supply chain risk prediction, fraud detection, and operational continuity across enterprise networks. © 2025 by the authors.

This study investigates the impacts of the cyber-attack, i.e. the false data injection attack (FDIA) on the SC and designs countermeasures to the FDIA. First, a novel SC framework is established from the control-theoretic perspective. The role of each member in the SC is conceptualized in accordance with the definition of the networked control system. Second, the FDIA is regarded as a distinctive SC risk, which is characterized by the malicious manipulation of transmitted data and the destruction of its authenticity. Third, the redundant channel strategy is employed to provide reliable communication channels that are free of cyber-attacks for emergency suppliers and temporary warehouses exchanging data with the decision centre. Furthermore, mixed integer programming models are proposed to determine countermeasures and optimize cyber-security investments. Through simulation-based analysis, the synergistic impacts of the FDIA on the SC performance under different cyber-attack intensities and different customer behaviours are examined. The results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed strategies in mitigating the adverse effects of the FDIA and improving SC resilience. The findings enhance the understanding of SC managers regarding the adoption of recovery strategies to mitigate cyber-attack risks. Moreover, the outcomes can be instructive for cyber-attackers when launching the FDIA in the SC context. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The supply chain organizations’ success is dependent on integration, teamwork, and the communication of information. Every day, supply chain and business players work in a dynamic setting. They must balance competing goals such as process robustness, risk reduction, vulnerability reduction, real financial risks, and resilience against just-in-time and cost-efficiency. Decision-making based on shared information in Supply Chain Collaboration constitutes the recital and competitiveness of the collective process. Supply Chain Collaboration has prompted companies to implement the perfect data analytics functions (e.g., data science, predictive analytics, and big data) to improve supply chain operations and, eventually, efficiency. Simulation and modeling are powerful methods for analyzing, investigating, examining, observing and evaluating real-world industrial and logistic processes in this scenario.

The AI integration in cyberspace has introduced sophisticated threats that pose serious risks to national security. This scenario presents a formidable challenge to cybersecurity professionals and scientists tasked with protecting sensitive data. The increasing frequency of cyber-attacks fueled by artificial intelligence demands creative ways to strengthen current security protocols. In the coming years, Blockchain technology will revolutionize various aspects of our lives. Many experts are comparing its significance to the advent of the internet. Blockchain may be a conveyed record innovation that works on a peer-to-peer (P2P) arrange, empowering worldwide information capacity over thousands of servers. This technology provides transparent access to entries in near-real-time. It functions as an online database accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The technology’s decentralized nature and transparent information distribution make it revolutionary, particularly in defense applications. Bitcoin, the most prominent application of blockchain, is a digital currency created and maintained electronically, relying on a distributed ledger of transactions. While maintaining this ledger requires significant effort, volunteers are incentivized through cryptocurrency rewards. Blockchain’s resilience, security, and immutability, stemming from its decentralized structure, make it highly advantageous in defense contexts. It can prevent cyber-attacks, enhance supply chain management, improve communications resilience, and secure sensitive data like personal and 3D printing information. However, the researchers are skeptical about blockchain’s benefits for defense operations, as there is a structural limitation to blockchain. The technology’s immutability is contingent on network size and participation distribution, raising potential vulnerabilities in permissionless networks. If compromised, permissioned networks or consortiums face severe consequences, highlighting the need for caution and awareness of blockchain’s challenges and limitations in defense implementations. In any case, there are various divisions of safeguard all around the world that are dealing with carrying out blockchain innovation for protection and security purposes. This chapter will likewise address exhaustively the improvements inside the primary nations and powers that are right now incorporating blockchain into their militaries, like China, Russia, and the US. This chapter investigates in detail how blockchain innovation is being utilized within the area of military cybersecurity. Its main goal is to promote a thorough understanding of current security threats, difficulties, and possible solutions. The objective of this chapter is to clarify how blockchain technology can be used as a strong defense against cyberattacks in military networks, communication systems, and data security infrastructure by exploring its many uses.

In this sense, systematic supply chain risk management can contribute to identifying such risks, assessing their severity, and developing mitigating plans, or even revealing the lack of such plans. Private hospital networks must also map their risks since they are facing a diminishing of demand given that unemployment in Brazil, which is growing in the past years, generates an impossibility of affording private healthcare. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how supply chain risk management is being applied in healthcare supply chains from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. This study considers supply chains located in the state of Rio de Janeiro. To accomplish this objective, we provide answers to two Research Questions: RQ1 - Is SCRM known as a concept among Rio de Janeiro healthcare supply chains? RQ2 - How are risk identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation being implemented by companies from the healthcare supply chains in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil? METHOD: Our research design is based on four steps: i) Research design; ii) Case selection: iii) Data collection (11 cases selected); iv) Data analysis. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that SCRM is an entirely unknown concept among healthcare supply chains from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. Managers have empirical knowledge of the risks, and they can identify the most hazardous risks and can come up with solutions to mitigate them, nevertheless, in many situations they do not have the authority or the manpower to implement the solutions, at most, managers implement local risk mitigation initiatives that do not consider the supply chains broader context. CONCLUSION: The healthcare organizations studied by this paper do not apply SCRM. They only apply local isolated solutions not considering a supply chain scope. This can become hazardous since isolated risk mitigation initiatives are often innocuous and have the potential to generate other risks. © 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved."

Although some thematic overlap has been noted, SCRES and SSCM are generally still considered to be two separate domains. However current global SC events and legislative initiatives demonstrate why it is important to view SCRES and SSCM in combination to solve the problem of long-term supply chain risks and disruptions. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether SCRES and SSCM can be integrated, which overlapping elements need to be considered and which main congruent capabilities exist. The exploratory study applies a citation network and main path analysis based on a dataset of two previously conducted systematic literature reviews. The literature review revealed great potential for combining the two research domains based on four identified connecting elements - supply chain capabilities, practices, risks and performance. We also identified great potential for the application of two main congruent capabilities - transparency and big data analytics. The four elements identified provide us with a useful basis for creating a theoretical framework for integrating SSCM and SCRES. We also highlight the importance of the congruent capabilities that are required to overcome paradoxical tensions between resilience and sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

On the downside, it entails cyber threats with significant risks for society in areas including business, environment, and health. Hence, to adequately manage these risks in the emerging digital world, there is a vital necessity to raise awareness, establish, maintain, and further develop cyber-security measures to ensure an appropriate level of protection along the entire value chain and supply chain.

While most disruptions originate upstream to a firm's immediate suppliers, unfortunately, most firms still lack visibility into the deeper tiers of the supply network. Beyond this, the extant literature on network resilience is mostly focused on simplistic static network analysis methods. We propose an effective method for resilience assessment of deep-tier supply networks. The proposed framework relies on discrete-event simulation informed by secondary data sources and global supply risk assessment/metric databases for improving the assessment of resilience for a firm. We also demonstrate that deep-tier visibility can be critical for effective resilience assessment of global networks. We validate the efficiency of the proposed method using a case-study informed by a real-world automotive supply network. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis approach is proposed to provide better directional guidance to decision-makers on the means to improve network resilience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The short study also examined how various innovative approaches can help promote sustainable production. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology examines hypothetical scenarios of the current pandemic and tries to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate careful, critical engagement by readers. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability challenges, such as environmental, social and economic viability challenges. The information in this report was gathered from numerous media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers and other sources to gain a better knowledge of the issue. Findings: As a result, most industry executives and policymakers are looking for appropriate strategies and policies to improve their practices and meet consumer demand. The outcomes explore that the COVID-19 pandemic is a central factor in changes in people’s behavior, reflecting sustainability such as environmental, social and economic responsibility. The COVID-19 outbreak, surprisingly, had a bigger effect on sustainable consumption, accompanied by environmental sustainability, and, to a lesser extent, social and economic viability. Research limitations/implications: Limited secondary evidence and data could not scrutinize the study’s actual problem statements. Hence, it is recommended that the gap in research be fulfilled by conducting a primary survey among various groups of economists, environmentalists and industrialists using the cluster sampling technique by validating the questionnaire of the total sustainable production system. Proposing frameworks for improving the resilience of production and a systematic possible upgraded manufacturing system by using the Industry 4.0 technology during operational processes could advance market demand. Practical implications: The COVID-19 scenario has compelled manufacturing firms to put their production systems on hold for an extended period while they seek long-term solutions to assure simple delivery and cooperation from both business and consumer standpoints. Various aspects of supply and demand are discussed in the referendum, as well as production and consumption challenges during the COVID-19 era. There is a need to restore the production system and find the right source of raw materials. This work focuses on commodity inventory management systems due to mass production, but due to pandemics, it is not in demand and vice versa. The researcher made comprehensible remarks on the use of digitization in the pandemic, which improves social distancing and social well-being and promotes the production system as well. Besides, manufacturing plants should switch to digital manufacturing to reduce the number of workplaces and hence the risk of an outbreak. Therefore, a better supply chain network is needed to supply more manufacturing units. Social implications: There is a bright side of coronavirus that the public health crisis raised worldwide has brought many opportunities for governments and society to make eternal reforms in the public health sector door. During restricted movements for fulfilling market demand, the Industry 4.0 technologies for automation, mechanization and digitalization can help significantly advance a company. This technological advancement and computer digitization for the perspective people may improve the environment, economic and social sustainability also increase social media adoption, which can be crucial for agri-businesses to evaluate customers’ behavior and consumption trends. Originality/value: The paper also instructed to identify critical success factors, barriers and drivers for dealing with the pandemic situation and to develop a strategic policy framework to improve production and process flexibility through the remarkable introduction of digital manufacturing. Before it is too late to stop the spread, producers and consumers must grasp the limits to which suppliers might drive nature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

These issues limit the efficiency and security of permissioned blockchain systems. To address these, a novel cryptographic framework, Permutations Supersonic Ligero Elliptic eXtended Merkle Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, is proposed. In permissioned blockchain-based FSC, metadata exposure and cross-entity data aggregation create privacy risks, allowing adversaries to infer sensitive operational insights by analyzing transaction patterns and correlating data fragments across entities. To mitigate this, the Permutations Supersonic Ligero Fractal (PSLF) is introduced, which ensures transparent, scalable, and compact proof generation, while preserving metadata privacy and preventing adversaries from reconstructing sensitive insights. Also enforces privacy-preserving protocols to limit data exposure across multiple participants and prevent leakage. Additionally, quantum threats, specifically through Shor’s algorithm, threaten the security of cryptographic systems used in FSC. To counter this, the Elliptic eXtended Merkle Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EXMC-DSA) is presented, which combines quantum-resistant key exchange and signature schemes, ensuring robust security against quantum attacks. This hybrid cryptographic approach ensures both current efficiency and future-proof resilience. As a result, the proposed model outperforms the existing methods in terms of low execution time, low proof generation, and verification time. © 2025, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2025 Madhuri Sadashiv Arade and Nitin N.

These systems play a crucial role in the anthropogenic water cycle, addressing treatment processes for water management while enhancing resource recovery. However, as critical nodes in the demand chain, they face increasing risks from sophisticated cyber threats that can compromise resource efficiency, stability, and environmental sustainability. This study explores the resilience of SEHs that incorporate electrical storage (ES), thermal storage (TS), and water storage (WS) facilities, highlighting their representation as energy hubs (EHs) for optimized resource management. A novel undetectable false data injection (FDI) attack is simulated, targeting thermal and water demands to exploit system vulnerabilities and destabilize the demand chain. To mitigate these risks, a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning (RL) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks is proposed to reconstruct incorrect data. The results demonstrate that FDI attacks can cause significant deviations in thermal (up to 17.1 %) and water demands (up to 17.7 %), threatening the operational stability of the demand chain. Implementing the proposed correction method reduces the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to 2.3884 % for thermal demands and 5.0803 % for water demands, showcasing its efficacy in stabilizing the demand chain. This study highlights the importance of effective drinking water treatment and distribution within smart farming contexts. By utilizing cutting-edge computational intelligence methods and combining renewable energy solutions with in-depth data analysis, this study enhances environmental restoration initiatives and strengthens risk assessment approaches to address cyber threats in water resource management. Ultimately, it emphasizes the need for innovative solutions that enhance the sustainability of water resources while ensuring resilience against emerging threats in both agricultural and urban settings. © 2025

We construct a comprehensive map of the Brazilian supply network using proprietary data on over 1.7 billion inter-firm transactions, including Pix (fast payments), boletos (invoices), and wire transfers (TEDs). By linking these data to detailed records of natural disasters, we assess how extreme climate events disrupt supplier–customer relationships. Exploiting a multiperiod difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate the causal effects of disasters on firm-to-firm payment flows. Our results show that affected suppliers experience significant reductions in payments from customers located outside the disaster region, with average declines of up to 8% following a shock. These effects are persistent and highly heterogeneous: agricultural firms face the most severe disruptions, with payment reductions approaching 20%, while other sectors such as construction and services also exhibit meaningful declines. Our findings contribute to a growing literature on climate-related economic fragility and production network resilience. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

The outbreak-as an extensive disruption-has caused a delay in ordering and delivering blood and its by-products, which leads to severe social and financial loss to healthcare organizations. This paper presents a robust multi-phase optimization approach to model a blood supply network ensuring blood is collected efficiently. We evaluate the effectiveness of the model using real-world data from two mechanisms. Firstly, a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based method is presented to find potential alternative locations for blood donation centers to maximize availability, accessibility, and proximity to blood donors. Then, a protective mathematical model is developed with the incorporation of (a) blood perishability, (b) efficient collation centers, (c) multiple-source of suppliers, (d) back-up centers, (e) capacity limitation, and (f) uncertain demand. Emergency back-up for laboratory centers to supplement and offset the processing plants against the possible disorders is applied in a two-stage stochastic robust optimization model to maximize the level of hospitals' coverage. The results highlight the fraction cost of considering back-up facilities in the total costs and provide more resilient decisions with lower risks by examining resource limitations. © 2022

These technologies are critical for a country that relies on imports for approximately 90% of its food supply and is vulnerable to disruptions, such as the 2017 blockade. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative regression analysis and qualitative interviews with industry experts to provide a comprehensive understanding. Regression analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between Supply Chain Efficiency (SCE) and Food Security (FS), showing that a 1-point increase in SCE can lead to a 0.42-point increase in FS. Cross-validation between quantitative data and interview themes was conducted to ensure reliability. The qualitative analysis highlights barriers, such as high costs and limited technical expertise, and demonstrates the benefits of blockchain in reducing food waste by 10% through improved transparency and traceability. Cold chain systems have ensured a steady supply of high-quality perishable items. Despite these advancements, Qatar’s reliance on imported food remains a significant risk. To address this challenge, the study advocates for a balanced approach combining technological innovations with strategies for boosting local food production, ensuring long-term resilience. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers to design strategies integrating supply chain advancements with localized agricultural development. The study’s approach can be compared with blockchain initiatives in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, which have enhanced food supply transparency.

Different risk perceptions among supply chain members can lead to inconsistencies in risk assessment and response strategies, thereby undermining a firm's ability to effectively manage political risk. However, existing research often overlooks the presence and potential impact of perceived political risk misalignment in supply chains. Therefore, this research explores the impact of perceived political risk misalignment between buyer firms and their suppliers on the operational resilience of buyer firms, and further examines the moderating roles of supply network characteristics. Using data from publicly listed U.S. manufacturing firms between 2020 and 2022, this study constructs 1421 dyadic pairs of suppliers and buyer firms, along with their supply networks, to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that perceived political risk misalignment significantly weakens the operational resilience of buyer firms. Moreover, the degree centrality of buyer firms amplifies this negative impact, while the clustering coefficient of the supply network mitigates it. By extending political risk research from the firm level to the supply chain context, this study enriches the literature on supply chain risk management and operational resilience, and emphasizes the importance of aligning risk perceptions within supply chains. © 2025 The Authors

While disruptions are rare, they can have catastrophic long-term economic or societal repercussions, and the recovery processes can be lengthy. These can tremendously affect the SC and make it vulnerable, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of these concerns has prompted the demand for improved disruption management by developing resilient, agile, and adaptive SC. The aim of this study is to introduce an assessment framework for prioritizing and evaluating the determinants to supply chain resilience (SCR). To analyze the empirical data, fuzzy criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (fuzzy CRITIC) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) have been incorporated. Fuzzy CRITIC method was used to identify the critical determinants and fuzzy TOPSIS method was applied for determining relative ranking of some real-world companies. Finally, by developing propositions an interpretive triple helix framework was proposed to achieve SCR. This research stands out for its originality in both methodology and implications. By introducing the novel combination of Fuzzy CRITIC and Fuzzy TOPSIS in the assessment of determinants to SCR and applying these determinants with the help of interpretive triple helix framework to establish a resilient SC, this study offers a unique and valuable contribution to the field of SCR. The key findings suggest that 'Responsiveness' followed by 'Managerial coordination and information integration' are the most significant determinant to achieve SCR. The outcome of this work can assist the managers to achieve SCR with improved agility and adaptivity. ©: © 2024 Amio et al.

It exacerbated pre-existing health inequalities, severely disrupted access to care, and worsened clinical outcomes for PLWNCDs, who were at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from the virus. The pandemic’s effects were likely magnified in humanitarian settings, where there were pre-existing gaps in continuity of care for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We sought to explore factors affecting implementation of NCD care in crisis settings during the COVID-19 pandemic and the adaptations made to support implementation. Methods: Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we undertook an online survey of 98 humanitarian actors from multiple regions and organization types (March-July 2021), followed by in-depth interviews with 13 purposively selected survey respondents (October-December 2021). Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics, while interview data were analysed thematically, using both deductive and inductive approaches. Results: Initially, humanitarian actors faced challenges influenced by external actors’ priorities, such as de-prioritisation of NCD care by governments, travel restrictions and supply chain interruptions. With each infection wave and lockdown, humanitarian actors were better able to adapt and maintain NCD services. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines was a positive turning point, especially for the risk management of people with NCDs and protection of health workers. Key findings include that, despite pre-existing challenges, humanitarian actors largely continued NCD services during the crisis. Enabling factors that supported continuity of NCD services included the ability to quickly pivot to remote means of communication with PLWNCDs, flexibility in medicine dispensing, and successful advocacy to prioritize NCD management within health systems. Key lessons learned included the importance of partnerships and cooperation with other health actors, and the mobilisation or repurposing of community health workers/volunteer networks. Conclusions: The COVID-19 experience should prompt national and global health stakeholders to strengthen inclusion of NCDs in emergency preparedness, response, and resilience planning. Key lessons were learned around remote care provision, including adapting to NCD severity, integrating community health workers, providing context-adapted patient information, combating misinformation, and strengthening cross-sectoral partnerships. © The Author(s) 2024.

Due to the integration of advanced technologies in food supply chain design, new challenges arise for supply chain robustness in consumer-driven behavior and climate change. AI algorithms will be absolutely necessary to assess the avoidable variability in food supply chains. Agents with their own objectives and preferences form networks. The evolution and robustness of networks can be simulated using agent-based models. As an advanced manufacturability and a complex food supply chain, a multi-agent system was built. A cloud-based platform allows agents in different locations to collaborate while keeping their data private. This research shows that cloud infrastructure simplifies and accelerates collaboration in a blockchain system. As supply chains evolve, the asymmetric nature of mutual dependencies imposes serious risks. The time-varying nature of supply chain relationships generates unknown feedback. Based on this uncertainty, a partially observable finite-state Markov decision process was developed for visibility estimation and redesign. It adopts a hybrid deep recurrent neural network to estimate the number of nodes and the biases of parameters. Devices with an ongoing impact on supply chains were identified via simulations and case studies. Conventional approaches assume that supply chain changes only happen occasionally and originally, while this approach detects highly dynamic changes comprehensively. As the depiction of supply chain structure, an ontology for ensuring information sharing was created through an integrated methodology involving data acquisition, coding, modeling, and validation. Aiming at serving various manufacturing industries, a recommender system based on a business model ontology was developed. This ontology mines customer preferences and generates a candidate strategy pool for managers. To conquer the trade-off between the quality of recommendations and costs, a multiobjective optimization model was derived. The efficiency and effectiveness of the recommender ontology were tested and verified, marking the first step for an AI supply chain to augment post-COVID-19 resilience. © 2024 Forester Communications Inc..

This study proposes a decentralized, tamper-proof blockchain framework to enhance drug traceability and authenticity verification. Unlike existing blockchain-based systems such as PharmaCrypt and Drugledger, which struggle with supply chain complexity, the proposed model employs unique key generation and multi-node key verification to authenticate distributed drugs. The system’s performance was evaluated using execution time, latency and throughput as key metrics. Results show an average execution time of 3500 milliseconds and a throughput of 55.6 transactions per second (TPS), outperforming current solutions. This improvement ensures that only genuine drugs reach end-users, enhances transparency, and significantly mitigates counterfeiting risks. By addressing critical challenges such as scalability and integration, the framework demonstrates blockchain’s transformative potential in securing pharmaceutical supply chains. The approach provides robust, real-time verification without reliance on centralized authorities, making it resilient to tampering and unauthorized access. Future enhancements will focus on integrating advanced cryptographic methods to strengthen data privacy, further improve performance, and scale the system for broader adoption across global pharmaceutical network. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, the massive interconnection of resource-constrained devices also amplifies the risks of eavesdropping, data tampering, and device impersonation. While digital signatures are indispensable for ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation, conventional schemes such as RSA and ECC are vulnerable to quantum algorithms, jeopardizing long-term trust in IIoT deployments. This study proposes a lightweight, stateless, hash-based signature scheme that achieves post-quantum security while addressing the stringent efficiency demands of IIoT. The design introduces two key optimizations: (1) Forest of Random Subsets (FORS) on Demand, where subset secret keys are generated dynamically via a PseudoRandom Function (PRF), thereby minimizing storage overhead and eliminating key-reuse risks; and (2) Winternitz One-Time Signature Plus (WOTS+) partial hash-chain caching, which precomputes intermediate hash values at edge gateways, reducing device-side computations, latency, and energy consumption. The architecture integrates a multi-layer Merkle authentication tree (Merkle tree) and role-based delegation across sensors, gateways, and a Signature Authority Center (SAC), supporting scalable cross-site deployment and key rotation. From a theoretical perspective, we establish a formal (Existential Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attack) EUF-CMA security proof using a game-based reduction framework. The proof demonstrates that any successful forgery must reduce to breaking the underlying assumptions of PRF indistinguishability, (second) preimage resistance, or collision resistance, thus quantifying adversarial advantage and ensuring unforgeability. On the implementation side, our design achieves a balanced trade-off between post-quantum security and lightweight performance, offering concrete deployment guidelines for real-time industrial systems. In summary, the proposed method contributes both practical system design and formal security guarantees, providing IIoT with a deployable signature substrate that enhances resilience against quantum-era threats and supports future extensions such as device attestation, group signatures, and anomaly detection. © © 2025 The Author."

Near-real-time analysis of infrastructure dependency information is a computationally intensive process that has generally been observed informally by public safety officials. While system-level information may be desired, it has been beyond the capabilities of most local public safety and emergency management agencies. To address this problem, a Grassroots Infrastructure Dependency Model (GRID-M) was developed to enable near-real-time analysis of physical infrastructure dependencies of specific supply and demand nodes within four lifeline sectors: electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater. The operational status of each node can be characterized as operational, partially operational, or not operational. These statuses are obtained by matching real-time outage or disruption data from utility providers with predetermined specific coping strategies based on a preincident limited infrastructure survey for specific assets within a network. This information can also be paired with a limited damage assessment to provide awareness of the accessibility to, and physical state of, each node within supply chains of interest. GRID-M displays all outputs within a Geographic Information Systems environment with additional prepopulated layers such as real-time traffic and demographic information of the affected communities. As such, GRID-M may be used following a major disaster to support the identification of priority response and recovery objectives based on the disruptions of critical local supply chains and their relationship with affected communities. © 2017 WIT Press

While digital immune systems (DIS) utilize AI and machine learning to spot and combat cyber risks in real-time, the systems are not immune to human-based threats like insider attacks, social engineering, and credential-based intrusions. These tactics leverage behavioral and psychological vulnerabilities rather than the technical ones, making them challenging for AI-based security solutions to catch. This study analyzes why automated cybersecurity mechanisms may have their limitations, and how human oversight may complement DIS, with potentially a behavioral forensic view of human oversight. This research discusses AI-run security models shortcomings using two well-known cyber incidents, the first being the Twitter Bitcoin Scam (2020) and the second being the Solar Winds cyberattack (2020). In both instances, attackers evaded automated security controls by exploiting human weaknesses via social engineering in Twitter’s case and a complex supply chain attack in SolarWinds. The first detects anomalies while the second relies on known attack signatures, therefore failing to recognize these attacks. Analysts later detected behavioral discrepancies that uncovered these breaches. Behavioral forensics is the intersection of psychology, criminology, and data analysis and holds the key to detecting deceptive behaviors and insider threats that AI-driven systems miss. This research analyzes the limitations of DIS and explores a cyber-physical infrastructure that essentially combines DIS with both behavioral forensics and human oversight to build a strong and adaptive cybersecurity framework. The findings discuss how a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) security model, explainable AI (XAI) and zero-trust frameworks can increase cyber resilience by balancing automation with human expertise.

The objective is to enhance the understanding of how these broad risk categories contribute to supply chain vulnerabilities, which is essential for improving global supply chain resilience. Additionally, the study examines the connections between SCR and its key indicators and operational risk factors to provide a comprehensive framework for global risk management. Design/methodology/approach – The study utilizes Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to develop three models. The first model focuses on the relationship between SCR and broad risk categories, including AML, ESG, SDG and sovereign risk. The second model analyzes the connection between SCR and specific risk indicators, such as access to basic services, climate change and renewable energy, equality and inclusion, operational risk, the prevalence of corruption, quality of institutions and others. The third model examines operational risk indicators, including adequate data protection, economic wealth, ICT development, inflation rate, the logistics performance index and political stability. Data from 191 countries in 2022 were used to explore these relationships. Findings – The analysis reveals significant interdependencies between SCR and the examined risk categories. AML and ESG risks are found to have a direct influence on supply chain vulnerabilities. Moreover, SCR is strongly impacted by indicators such as access to basic services, political stability, and the strength of human rights. In terms of operational risk, key influencing factors include data protection levels, GDP per capita, and logistics performance. These findings validate the hypothesis that SCR is directly linked to both broader risk categories and specific operational indicators, underscoring the need for integrated risk management strategies. Originality/value – This research offers a novel contribution by mapping the complex relationships between SCR and various risk categories, including AML, ESG and specific operational factors. The application of BBNs provides a new perspective on understanding the interconnections between country-level risks and their impact on supply chain resilience. The study provides actionable insights for businesses and policymakers aiming to strengthen supply chain resilience in a globalized environment. It also lays the groundwork for future research to explore these relationships in different regions or industries, offering practical value for both theory and practice. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited

However, the lack of cascading risk modeling techniques makes it challenging to determine how disruptions in one economic sector propagate to others through the supply chain. In this study, we construct a national multilayer cascading risk model using 2017 multiregional input-output data from China and simulate shock propagation. Our results show that the originating sector and geographic location of a shock are critical in determining the collapse’s effects. The probability of a large avalanche (>1000 collapsed nodes) varies from 2 to 80% across provinces and from 1 to 96% across layers. Food production and processing, chemical smelting, and energy supply are critical layers that amplify the cascade effects of shocks. Grain regions like Henan and Hunan, manufacturing hubs such as Guangdong, and water and energy suppliers like Sichuan and Hubei face high cascading risks. Our scenario analyses show that reducing output dependence on nodes decreases the system’s avalanche size by 20-40% while improving water production efficiency reduces it by 10-22%. These results highlight the importance of diversifying supply sources and optimizing water use efficiency to enhance network resilience. © 2025 American Chemical Society.

As an example, a key objective of transport infrastructure is to ensure mobility and resilient access to public services, including for the population, service providers, and associated supply chains. We introduce a new user-centric measure for estimating infrastructure criticality and urban accessibility to critical public services - particularly healthcare facilities without loss of generality - and the effects of disaster-induced infrastructure disruptions. Accessibility measures include individuals’ choices of all services in each sector. The approach is scalable and modular while preserving detailed features necessary for local planning decisions. It relies on open data to simulate various disaster scenarios, including floods, seismic, and compound shocks. We present results for Lima, Peru, and Manila, Philippines, to illustrate how the approach identifies the most affected areas by shocks, underserved populations, and changes in accessibility and critical infrastructure components. We capture the changes in people’s choices of health service providers under each scenario. For Lima, we show that the floods of 2020 caused an increase in average access times to all health services from 33 minutes to 48 minutes. We identify specific critical road segments for ensuring access under each scenario. For Manila, we locate the 22% of the population who lost complete access to all higher health services due to flooding of over 15 cm. The approach is used to identify and prioritize targeted measures to strengthen the resilience of critical public services and their supporting infrastructure systems, while putting the population at the center of decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s).

This study proposes a hybrid framework that integrates machine learning and optimization to address a stochastic supply chain network design problem, incorporating customer behavior and potential disruptions. Specifically, unsupervised machine learning techniques are employed for demand clustering, enabling the identification of distinct customer segments based on purchasing patterns. These clusters support more accurate demand forecasting and enable pricing strategies. The clustered demand profiles are then utilized in a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) that optimizes the supply chain network. The model operates under uncertainty, considering stochastic demand and partial disruptions in distribution centers. To manage the risk associated with uncertainties, the Conditional Value-at-Risk (C-VaR) metric is incorporated into the optimization framework. Furthermore, Lagrangian relaxation is used to efficiently handle complex and non-convex constraints. The proposed approach is validated using a real-world industrial case study, demonstrating both its practical relevance and strategic value. Results from a real-world industrial case show that the data-driven clustering improved profit margins by approximately 28% compared to a deterministic benchmark, demonstrating significant pricing effectiveness. Furthermore, the integrated framework achieved a 92% disruption recovery rate and reduced lost sales by over 30% compared to traditional models, confirming enhanced network resilience. Overall, this methodology supports more robust, data-driven decision-making in dynamic and uncertain supply chain environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

Applying sustainability and resilience concepts in a supply chain means the simultaneous optimization of the cost and recourses, including human and environmental ones, in facing possible risks. This paper tries to fill this gap by considering them simultaneously in a closed-loop supply chain. For this, a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) model was formulated for a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, different dimensions of sustainable development have been taken into account through reducing the total cost, energy consumption, and pollution and increasing job opportunities, and multiple-sourcing strategy has been applied for the resiliency of the supply chain. To validate the proposed model, the real data of a tire industry was used and the model was solved using the ε-Constraint method. The results emphasized the necessity of combining sustainability and resilience in a closed-loop supply chain, where the high amounts of demand, in addition to increasing the cost, energy consumption, and pollution, increase job opportunities and the need to backup suppliers for raw materials. © 2020 Kharazmi University.

The outputs are aimed at providing policy and practitioner guidance on ways to enhance supply chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach: The research models the resilience of New Zealand's log export logistical network. A two-tier approach is developed; linear programming is used to model the aggregate-level resilience of the nation's ports, then discrete event simulation is used to evaluate operational constraints and validate the capacity of operational flows from forests to ports. Findings: The synthesis of linear programming and discrete event simulation provide a holistic approach to evaluate supply chain resilience and enhance operational efficiency. Strategically increasing redundancy can be complimented with operational flexibility to enhance network resilience in the long term. Research limitations/implications: The two-tier modelling approach has only been applied to New Zealand's log export supply chains, so further applications are needed to insure reliability. The requirement for large quantities of empirical data relating to operational flows limited the simulation component to a single region Practical implications: New Zealand's log export supply chain has low resilience; in most cases the closure of a port significantly constrains export capacity.

Lean and resilience are operationalised with practice bundles and core functions, respectively. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses the Bayesian inference approach to analyse systematically encoded data from firms that faced disruptions in their supply chain. The data were collected from publicly available sources, and encoded using predefined constructs prior to analysis. Findings - Findings show that the synergetic relations between operational resilience and lean in mitigating performance losses outweigh the trade-off. Just-in-time/flow and total productive maintenance lean practices appear to be major sources for the trade-off; there is limited-synergy leveraged on the anticipative (sense) capability of operational resilience. Research limitations/implications - The dependence on secondary data and small sample size are possible limitations. Future research may employ large-scale studies with the same encoding approach by combining both primary and secondary sources. Practical implications - This study implies that companies need not abandon their lean implementation in order to be resilient against unanticipated disruptive circumstances. Most lean practices can be used to leverage agility to mitigate disruptions. Originality/value - This is a first study to empirically compare synergy/trade-off between operational resilience and lean with reference to changes in operations performance upon disruption. It is also a first study to investigate sources of synergy/trade-off at lean practice bundles and resilience core functions level.

The bi-objective bid evaluation problem is optimized using a fuzzy multi-objective method. Key features of this work include substitution options, partial fulfillment policies, and prioritization of relief items based on urgency. To cope with uncertain parameters, robust optimization is employed. The model is validated using a case study from District 4 of Tehran, using 2024 population data reported by the Tehran Municipality, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing costs and response times while ensuring supply chain continuity. The results emphasize that reinforcing local distribution centers enhances responsiveness during disasters, while engaging backup and spot market suppliers strengthens flexibility under disruption. Moreover, effective budget allocation significantly reduces procurement costs and delivery delays, ensuring supply continuity and improved resilience across the humanitarian logistics network. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

These goods need appropriate transportation and storage facilities due to their perishable nature and concise shelf life to reach the customers in fresh condition. Due to a lack of agricultural investment, the nation is susceptible to global pricing and exchange rate changes. The people concerned must put in a lot of work to accomplish this. The entire supply chain is rise with problems like lack of pricing transparency (at farmer’s end), traders domination, inadequate supply chain links, etc. Due to the farmer’s loss of income and the other chain of custody participants’ increased expenditures, the final consumer is ultimately forced to shoulder an elevated financial burden. The troubles engaged in this supply network have evolved dramatically and have impacted not only those in the supply chain but also the entire agricultural industry in India since organised retail has started expressing interest in marketing vegetables and fruits that are fresh, and they are currently entering the market in huge investments. In order to build a bridge between the rural and urban markets, the current study conducts a thorough evaluation of all relevant basic and contemporary literature. The supply chain’s unrecognised issues and pertinent research needs are also highlighted. The research project being suggested is exploratory and will make use of secondary sources. The data and information were gathered from numerous reports, periodicals, magazines, websites, etc. The major goal of this research is to comprehend the limitations of nation's management of supply chains for perishable commodities and to examine the different difficulties and opportunities that arise in routine product handling. The farmers will benefit from the quick entry of corporations into the selling of fruits and vegetables since they are establishing direct relationships with farmers and cutting out middlemen at all levels. The main obstacle is figuring out how to implement supply chain management best practices including collaboration forecasting, data integration, and increased usage. A competent management of the supply chains of perishable items will be essential in helping India’s economy flourish and become a worldwide leader in the food sector because the country’s economy is still largely agrarian. With an abundance of resources and potential, India’s rural and urban markets should be more closely integrated through effective vendor, warehousing, and logistics management. There are several reasons for the finest supply chain danger analysis available in the Indian industry. India’s economy, which is among the fastest-growing in the world, has grown to become a significant participant in the world's supply chains. To maintain efficient operations and reduce disruptions, nevertheless, the Indian market poses certain risks and problems that must be effectively managed. Here are some crucial details emphasising the importance of this study. The technique essentially presupposes that the building’s material behaves in a linear elastic fashion and that sufficient protection may be maintained by appropriately limiting the pressures in the material caused by the anticipated “working loads” on the structure. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

This study aims to (1) develop an optimization model reconciling logistical costs with CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, (2) quantify energy savings from route restructuring, and (3) assess how geopolitical disruptions reshape trade patterns. Using network theory—Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path algorithms—we reconfigure the 2018 crude oil network (178 countries, UN Comtrade data) by prioritizing proximity, volume, and emission constraints. Results reveal stark contrasts: the optimized network reduces total energy consumption by 81 % for importers and 85 % for exporters, achieved through streamlined routes and redistributed trade flows. Geopolitical shifts, including post-Ukraine war sanctions and U.S.-China competition, are shown to dynamically reshape trade patterns, favoring regionalized supply chains over traditional hubs. Environmental assessments highlight maritime transport as a critical emission source, underscoring the dual benefit of route optimization in curbing both economic costs and carbon footprints. The study underscores the necessity of integrating environmental metrics into trade policy frameworks. By decoupling logistical optimization from emission analysis, it offers a scalable model for balancing energy security with sustainability. Policymakers are urged to adopt adaptive strategies that mitigate geopolitical risks while advancing decarbonization goals, particularly amid escalating global tensions and climate imperatives. This research bridges structural and behavioral dynamics in oil trade networks, providing a roadmap for resilient, low-carbon energy systems in an era of unprecedented geopolitical and ecological challenges. © 2025 The Authors

The growing interdependence of global trade networks makes them more susceptible to disruptions, highlighting the importance of digital transformation in mitigating risks and enhancing efficiency. Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (loT), blockchain, and big data analytics play a crucial role in driving digital transformation, offering promising solutions to address these challenges. This chapter examines how digital advancements can be strategically leveraged to build sustainable and resilient supply networks aligned with broader sustainability objectives. It explores key aspects of supply chain sustainability, resilience, and circular economy practices while highlighting the transformative role of emerging digital technologies. The discussion also delves into the challenges and barriers faced by organisations during digital transitions, emphasising the need for strategic implementation. The findings indicate that digital transformation is facilitating the shift of traditional supply chains towards a new phase of digitalisation, integrating data- driven insights to optimise performance and minimise environmental impact. However, while digital technologies present significant benefits, their adoption also comes with challenges such as cybersecurity threats, high implementation costs, and the need for skilled personnel. The chapter also explores future trends, including quantum computing, digital twins, and 5G technology, which are expected to revolutionise supply chains further. These technological advancements will reshape global supply chain management, making it more adaptive, efficient, and sustainable in the years to come. © 2025 by Disha Gulia, Sapna Arora, Mohit Malik, Vijay Kumar Gahlawat and Ashish Mor.

Past hurricanes have demonstrated the vulnerability of petroleum supply chains to these extreme events; however, models are lacking for hurricane performance assessment of petroleum supply chain infrastructure. In this study, a probabilistic framework is presented for the performance assessment of oil supply chain infrastructure (OSCI) subjected to hurricane events, spanning from a methodological definition to implementation to opportunities and needs. The framework leverages Bayesian networks for probabilistic analysis of connectivity and flow within the oil supply chain, alongside fragility functions for physical damage and functionality assessment of supply chain components. A literature survey is conducted to identify the tools enabling the proposed framework. Application of the method for probabilistic assessment of tightly interrelated oil supply chains subjected to hurricane events is demonstrated with a representative OSCI comprised of platforms, ports, pipelines, refineries, storage facilities, power, and transportation infrastructure. In addition to investigating the impact of alternative levels of hazard exposure and the effectiveness of different mitigation actions, the framework affords the potential for Bayesian updating as new data come online regarding the component performance or product availability/flow. The proposed framework can provide a foundation to support risk mitigation and resilience enhancement efforts in the petroleum industry. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Given the complex nature of resilience, it is important for any such assessment to incorporate a multi-dimensional view of resilient behavior. To help address this gap in the literature, we propose an extended slack-based super-efficiency data envelopment analysis for evaluating the performance of SCR strategies when they might be utilized concurrently. The new approach characterizes resilience performance by considering the cost of implementing a set of resilience strategies (resilience cost) as an input to the assessment process, and by considering (1) the resulting cost of the disruption, (2) the impact on the service level, and (3) the associated recovery time as outputs. Taken together, these metrics allow for assessing the combined performance of each candidate set of resilience strategies under their synergistic effects. This new and comprehensive approach for resilience assessment is carefully incorporated into a framework that ranks different subsets of relevant strategies for any given supply chain, according to their relative effectiveness across a variety of different disruption scenarios. The proposed decision framework is able to help decision-makers identify the best ensemble of resilience strategies available. A real-world case study is used to illustrate the significant potential of the framework, and a number of important managerial insights are provided to help decision-makers more effectively analyze and implement their own optimal subsets of SCR strategies, particularly in the presence of network quality or budgetary constraints. Theoretical implications include advancing the understanding of multi-strategy interactions in SCR, while practical implications focus on guiding SC managers in selecting and implementing the most effective resilience strategies under various conditions. © 2024

The consequential disruptions can potentially propagate through supply chains, resulting in widespread economic losses. Previous studies to quantify the risks of port disruptions have adopted various modelling assumptions about the resilience of individual ports and marine network logistics. However, limited empirical evidence is available to validate these modelling assumptions or to provide deeper understanding of the ways in which operations are adapted during and after disruptions. Here, we use vessel tracking data to analyse past port disruptions due to natural disasters, evaluating 141 incidences of disruptions across 74 ports and 27 disasters. Results show a median disruption duration of six days with a 95th percentile of 22.2 days. All analysed events show multiple ports being affected simultaneously, challenging some of the studies that only focus on single port disruptions. Moreover, we find that the duration of the disruption scales with the severity of the event, with an increment of 1.0 m storm surge or 10 m/s wind speed associated with a two day increase in disruption duration. In contrast to commonplace assumptions in model studies, substitution between ports is rarely observed during short-term disruptions. On the other hand, production recapture happens in practice in many cases of port disruptions. In short, empirical vessel tracking data provides valuable insights for future modelling studies in order to better approximate the extent of the disruption and the potential resilience of the port and maritime network. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Port operations calls for an effective approach to assess ports vulnerability and to ensure the resilience of their associated maritime supply chains (MSC). However, traditional quantitative risk analysis reveals challenges due to data incompleteness and ambiguity, and operational and environmental uncertainty when being applied in ports vulnerability analysis. This paper aims to develop a novel port vulnerability assessment (PVA) framework, which can guide and realise a standardised vulnerability analysis process for the ports from different geographies involving in the same MSC and hence the resources can be better managed from a global network level for optimal resilience of the chain. It is especially important for the shipping and port industries which are in nature international and desires strong international uniform standardization. The fuzzy theory, evidential reasoning (ER) approach, and expected utility theory are combined in a holistic way to form the proposed PVA framework. The new framework is validated and demonstrated by using a case study in which five key ports along an established MSC in China are investigated. The findings can be used as a stand along method to compare the vulnerability levels of the ports in an MSC and/or integrated with decision optimisation methods for rational safety resource distribution from a supply chain perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

This theoretical paper examines the lessons learned from the pandemic and proposes a long-lasting approach to address current supply chain shortcomings. We draw on supply chain theory insights to identify key pandemic-related challenges, including insufficient visibility into supplier and customer networks, critical supply and component shortages, and the necessity for agile and resilient supply chain operations. This paper suggests several prescriptive recommendations to address these challenges, including the use of machine learning and data analytics to enhance supply chain visibility and forecasting, the creation of more robust contingency plans and risk management tactics, and the execution of cutting-edge technologies like AI, BT and IoT to boost supply chain traceability and transparency. The prescriptive approach extracted from contemporary literature encompasses a long-term roadmap to transform supply chain operations to become more sustainable, responsive, and resilient. This roadmap includes integrating supply chain functions with other business processes and adopting new business models prioritizing collaboration, flexibility, and innovation. The extensive literature review highlighted twenty supply chain bottlenecks and possible solutions to keep the supply chain upright and sustainable, which can handle uneven shocks like pandemics, natural disasters, etc. Several instances are also discussed to validate the effectiveness of possible recommendations for the existing supply chains. The proposed prescriptive approach includes enhanced supply chain performance, reduced risk and cost, and improved customer satisfaction. We argue that the lessons erudite from the pandemic present a unique opportunity for supply chain experts to reconsider and transform their operations to address the challenges of a complex and uncertain global business environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

Among these are Process Supply Chains that can be described as interconnected sets of entities responsible for the sourcing, production and distribution of a large set of chemical and/or bio- based products. Due to the high diversity of materials, processes and information flows such networks result in highly complex systems that are very difficult to manage. The PSE community has a critical role to support the design and management of such systems through the development of tools that are able to address such complexity. Focusing initially on a real-world process supply chain, the industrial gas supply chain, this paper identifies and discusses current contributions, challenges and perspectives in process supply chains that can guide research professionals to address such challenges. In general, such challenges encompass supply chain scope representations, modeling approaches, data management and implementation. Examples include supply chain risk and uncertainty, multiscale decisions, sustainability and resiliency. © 2019

Unlike highways, trains often do not have the ability to take alternative routes that directly connect major metropolitan areas; hence railroad networks are vulnerable to disruptions like accidents. This study developed a data mining workflow to rank commodity movements that are at the highest risk of disruption from railroad accidents and other types of regional disasters that can affect railroad operations. A key finding is that five U.S. metropolitan areas are at least five times more likely than others to experience a railroad accident. Those five areas account for more than 40% of the monetary value in alcoholic beverages, raw meats, gasoline, plastic-based products, and rubber-based products moved by rail. Hence, any disruption in those five areas can lead to widespread shortages of those commodities. The implication is that decision makers should focus risk mitigation and resiliency strategies in those five metropolitan areas and on the top commodity categories at risk. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

The intention is to expose intricate linkages between components by dismantling the conventional research division. Supply networks are being more impacted by world events. Decisions on strategy must therefore consider the effects of every occurrence. A qualitative study comprising sixteen saturated semi-structured interviews was utilized to guarantee the depth and richness of the data. The three phases of thematic analysis were as follows: formulation of topics, coding, and familiarization with the data. A systematic framework for interpreting data and delving more deeply into the experiences and perspectives of participants was provided by the three-stage theme analysis approach, which was ultimately chosen. This feature enhances the validity of the findings by enabling a meticulous examination of the data while retaining the flexibility to detect emerging trends. The findings of the study offer valuable insights into the complex interconnections among climate change, social and political instability, and risk management in global supply chains. It has been determined that risk mitigation strategies, environmental changes, and geopolitical events are all significant variables that influence supply chain resilience. To mitigate the effects of external uncertainties on disruptions in the supply chain, proactive risk management has grown in significance. This underscores the critical necessity for adaptive approaches to effectively navigate evolving geopolitical and environmental circumstances.

Second, a model for supply chain risk propagation is created. The model assumes that when a supplier node fails as a result of an external shock, an alternative node can take over the seed provider node’s supply function, enhancing the supply chain network’s fault tolerance and recovery. Finally, the real supply chain data of a manufacturing enterprise are obtained, and its structure is reconstructed using the model built in this paper. On this basis, the robustness of the initial supply chain and the fractal supply chain is measured separately, as well as the risk propagation in the two supply chains. The experimental results show that the supply chain structure established in this paper has strong robustness and can better resist risk propagation. This paper breaks through the problem that the construction of a fractal supply chain remains at the theoretical level and forms a concrete and operational industrial application, which has important theoretical and practical values. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

However, the prefabricated building supply chain (PBSC) faces many risks and challenges in actual operation, which pose a serious threat to the stability and sustainable development of the supply chain (SC). Taking the PB project of Enterprise J as an example, this paper deeply explores the risk propagation mechanism in its SC and proposes a practical risk control strategy, aiming to enhance the risk resistance and resilience of the SC and ensure its sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the actual contract data of Enterprise J, this study constructed a four-layer PBSC network model, covering PB contractors, material suppliers, module manufacturers, and PB construction enterprises. By identifying and evaluating the main risk factors in the SC, combined with the improved Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation method and the cloud-matter element evaluation model, the weight and vulnerability of each risk factor were analyzed. MATLAB R2022b software was further used to simulate the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model to analyze the impact of different risk control strategies on risk propagation. Findings: This study analyzed the PBSC network of J Company and found that it has high connectivity and low group characteristics, which promotes the rapid spread of risks. SIRS model analysis shows that the infection rate is most sensitive to risk transmission, and a higher infection rate accelerates the spread, emphasizing the importance of controlling the initial infection rate. The recovery rate significantly affects the speed of risk transmission, while the immune extinction rate affects the long-term stability of the SC. The betweenness centrality strategy based on betweenness centrality performs well in controlling risk transmission, and can effectively reduce the number of infected enterprises and shorten the recovery time. The study also found that PB contractors and material suppliers are key links and are prone to become the source of risk transmission; while module manufacturers and PB construction enterprise show strong risk resistance. Practical implications: This study provides a new theoretical framework and practical strategy for risk management of PBSC of enterprise J, helping enterprises to identify key risk nodes and effectively control risk propagation through reasonable immunization strategies, thereby enhancing the stability and resilience of the SC. The research results provide strong support for coping with external uncertainties and technological changes, and promote the healthy development of enterprise J. Originality/value: This study takes the PBSC network of J Company as an empirical object, deeply analyzes its risk propagation mechanism and control strategy, and has significant academic innovation and practical value. By constructing a four-layer weighted directed network model that conforms to the actual operation of the enterprise, and combining the SIRS model for dynamic simulation analysis, this study reveals the key impact of infection rate, recovery rate and immune extinction rate on SC risk propagation, and provides a new perspective and theoretical basis for J Company’s SC risk management. In particular, the betweenness immunization strategy based on betweenness centrality, as an innovative solution, provides a practical path for enterprises to identify and control key risk nodes. The study also further analyzes the vulnerability and recovery capacity of different levels, and proposes targeted strategies to enhance the resilience and risk resistance of the enterprise SC. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of J Company’s SC risk management, but also provides an operational practical guide for it to improve the stability of the SC and cope with the challenges of external uncertainty. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Amid increasing complexities in the global economic landscape, risks and uncertainties within iron ore supply chains have intensified, particularly under the influence of geopolitical conflicts and trade protectionism. Leveraging 2023 iron ore trade data, this study constructs a global iron ore trade network using complex network theory and develops a cascading failure model to assess systemic vulnerabilities. Key findings include: ⅰ:The iron ore trade system exhibits a centralized structure dominated by China, Australia, and Brazil, resulting in elevated supply risks. Supply disruptions could propagate crises, potentially disrupting supply chains in over 40% of participating nations.ⅱ:Community 1 (China, Australia, Brazil) accounts for 90% of trade volume and demonstrates heightened susceptibility to cascading failures. In contrast, Community 2 (Canada, Germany, South Africa) mitigates crisis propagation through diversified supply strategies. Enhanced cross-community linkages facilitated by nations like India reduce systemic risks. ⅲ:Critical node failures yield disproportionate impacts: Increasing the risk resilience parameter β from 0.2 to 0.4 reduces cascade magnitude by 62%.

Similarly, a possible future conflict between China and Taiwan could lead to substantial disruptions in the availability of high-tech components and other goods produced by Taiwan that are widely used in manufacturing worldwide. It is necessary to understand and proactively address such potential supply chain vulnerabilities for critical goods and services. This paper applies a dynamic nonequilibrium model to identify the forward and backward dependencies of individual industrial, manufacturing, service, and energy sectors in a multi-regional context. The model tracks the macroeconomic variables of economies from their initial equilibrium state into a nonequilibrium stationary state, and quantifies their susceptibility, resilience, and recovery to shocks in the networked economic system. Through this analysis, the paper examines the impact of excluding Taiwan from global economic networks, revealing substantial impacts on major economies and sectors essential to the operating of the global economy. The approach presented and empirically tested enables policymakers and stakeholders to proactively use data-driven insights to anticipate future outcomes and reduce disruption risks. © 2025 The Authors

Efficient resource utilization is a central concern in supply chain sustainability. However, when designing proactive supply chains with a focus on disruption risk, it often results in network redundancy and the allocation of resources in anticipation of potential disruptions. The joint analysis of supply chain resilience and sustainability is crucial for company, as it allow them to identify and mitigate risks, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen their ability to adapt to economic, environmental, and social challenges. Despite the considerable attention given to resilient supply chain design in the literature, there exists a research gap in the simultaneous design of supply chains that are both resilient and sustainable. This article provides a systematic review of contemporary literature, focusing on the exploration of supply chain resilience from two perspectives: robustness and recoverability, and the interaction of these approaches with supply chain sustainability. To carry out a thorough evaluation of the literature, we will use the VOSviewer software. This tool enables the analysis and visualization of bibliometric data and networks, facilitating the identification of clusters among documents or authors who exhibit shared similarities in content or collaborative efforts.

To analyze the impact of supply disruptions in upstream mineral enterprises on supply chain resilience, we construct a supply chain network and employ the SIR model to simulate disruptions. Subsequently, a two-dimensional framework is proposed to evaluate the impacts of disruption severity and node risk capacity on supply chain resilience. This study also compares the impacts of disruptions in three critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, and nickel). The investigation reveals the following: (1) Node risk capacity can enhance EV LIB SC resilience. Notably, increased resilience investment does not lead to sustained improvements. (2) Regarding robustness, disruptions in lithium mining have the greatest impact, followed by cobalt, while disruptions in nickel have the least effect. However, in terms of recoverability, the effects of disruptions across the three mineral enterprises are similar. © 2025

To explore the copper industry chain's resistance to such risks, this article constructs a trade network for the global copper industry chain based on complex network methods, utilizing 2022 data on copper ores and concentrates, blister copper, refined copper, copper semis, and copper waste and scrap. It assesses the industry's resilience from both static and dynamic perspectives, and analyzes the risk resistance capacity of core countries. The results indicate that: (1) in the copper industry chain, copper semis, copper waste and scrap exhibit a relatively high level of overall resilience, but copper ores and concentrates, blister copper, and refined copper display a lower level of overall resilience. This indicates that the upstream of the copper industry chain is more susceptible to external factors than that of the downstream. (2) Targeted factors such as economic sanctions and trade disputes have a more serious impact on the copper industry chain than random factors such as natural disasters and transportation interruptions. Meanwhile, targeted factors have a stronger impact on the transmission efficiency and connectivity of the network. (3) There are significant communities in the copper industry chain, with some core countries playing an important role in connecting the network. In terms of connectivity, influence, and control, developed countries represented by the United States and the United Kingdom are stronger than the other two groups; emerging developed countries like Japan and South Korea exhibit lower propagation and intermediary capacities; emerging industrialized countries represented by Brazil and South Africa fall somewhere between the first two. Additionally, China and India demonstrate relatively important influence within the copper industry chain. Finally, this article provides policy recommendations for maintaining the stability of the copper industry chain and enhancing its resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach is used. The unit of analysis is the Indian dairy supply chain (IDSC). Data were collected from nine major dairy cooperatives and five major private firms operating across the Indian states. A total of 28 face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with two individuals from each case dairy organisation during January 2016 to December 2017. Findings: Disruption sources in the IDSC are both external and internal and impact the quality of products and the distribution network. Compared to developed economies, in an emerging economy context such as India, the number of disruptions is very high. These disruptions negatively impact resilience and affect efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness and product quality. Research limitations/implications: The findings stress the importance of integration across upstream and downstream processes in the IDSC. However, contextual factors should also be considered when designing the supply chain configuration. Small supply sources may be conceptualised as distributed sources that can be consolidated on the move using logistics and IT-enabled solutions. Moreover, the underlying processes of the dairy supply chain need to adapt to the external environment, and internal causes of disruptions should be eliminated through process redesign. Practical implications: The findings highlight that the efficient operation of the IDSC is challenged by disruptions, the fragmentation of various stages and poor support infrastructure. The findings may be useful in managing supply networks which have linkages in emerging economies. Social implications: The upstream stage of the IDSC involves many small- and medium-sized unorganised producers. The overall inefficiency and poor value generation across the entire IDSC constrain the livelihood and interests of these unorganised producers. Therefore, supply chain design needs to be aligned with social context. Originality/value: The central contribution of this article is to present sources of disruptions that impact dairy supply chain performance in an emerging economy context. Areas requiring process improvement are also highlighted. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Its foci are being expanded from classical safety, through security to resilience. Addressing risk-based resilience within the context of freight transport networks requires integration across disciplines and research methodologies. The research community currently lacks a critical understanding of the definition and characteristics of transport resilience in general and the research methods capable of tackling the uncertainty of modeling and measuring resilience in specific cases. Such uncertainty can result from the unavailability and incompleteness of historical data relating to nonclassical risks at a local component level and the randomness of risk influences among the elements of freight transport networks from a global system perspective. This article aims to review the definitions of resilience in freight transport, describe its characteristics, analyze the research methods applied in different transportation contexts/processes, and propose new techniques to deal with the relevant uncertainty and challenges. It will provide useful insights into understanding freight transportation resilience and deliver a novel content, which enables the quantification of freight transport resilience caused by non-classical (e.g. climate) risks for their effective control and facilitates the movement of freight transport resilience research from a local component level to a global network perspective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to investigate how multinational companies (MNCs) are responding to the phenomenon of accumulated major disruptions in recent years and plausible new paradigm of unstable conditions and environmental uncertainty from a supply chain resilience (SCRES) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Following an inductive interpretivist approach based on interpretive phenomenology, this study gathers insights from ten MNCs supply chain managers and international consultants who participated as key informants via semi-structured interviews, sharing their experience of the phenomenon. Additionally, secondary sources such as press releases, media articles and industry reports were used for data collection. Findings: Findings include five categories of recovery actions, i.e. levelling, rationing, buffering, bridging and boundary redefining, key strategic changes in competitive priorities, internal organisation and coordination structures, and a hierarchy between SCRES characteristics, integrated in an empirically derived conceptual framework connecting these constructs. This contributes to middle-range theories within SCRES body of knowledge. The authors also identify a set of areas for future SCRES research. Practical implications: Findings can support MNCs’ supply chain professionals in designing and managing resilient global supply chains, based on learnings from the recent highly disruptive environment, particularly, regarding recovery actions and resilience-building strategic changes contributing to agility and robustness in global supply chains. Originality/value: Non-positivist interpretive and inductive works are scarce in SCRES research. By adopting this novel approach for this field, the authors broadened the categorisation of responses used in previous works and identified prominent strategic changes and SCRES characteristics and relations among constructs, thus bringing conceptual clarity to SCRES research within the context of the study. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

While extant literature offers important insights into the resilience of CIs following large-scale disasters, our understanding of CI resilience to the more typical disruptions that affect CIs on a day-to-day basis remains limited. The present study investigates how the interorganizational (supply) network that uses and manages the CI can mitigate the adverse consequences of day-to-day disruptions. Design/methodology/approach: Longitudinal archival data on 277 day-to-day disruptions within the Dutch national railway CI were collected and analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Findings: The empirical results largely support the study’s predictions that day-to-day disruptions have greater adverse effects if they co-occur or are relatively unprecedented. The findings further show that the involved interorganizational network can enhance CI resilience to these disruptions, in particular, by increasing the overall level of cross-boundary information exchange between organizations inside the network. Practical implications: This study helps managers to make well-informed choices regarding the target and intensity of their cross-boundary information-exchange efforts when dealing with day-to-day disruptions affecting their CI. The findings illustrate the importance of targeting cross-boundary information exchange at the complete interorganizational network responsible for the CI and to increase the intensity of such efforts when CI disruptions co-occur and/or are unprecedented. Originality/value: This study contributes to our academic understanding of how network-level processes (i.e. cross-boundary information exchange) can be managed to ensure interorganizational (supply) networks’ resilience to day-to-day disruptions in a CI context. Subsequent research may draw from the conceptual framework advanced in the present study for examining additional supply network-level processes that can influence the effectiveness of entire supply networks. As such, the present research may assist scholars to move beyond a simple dyadic context and toward examining complete supply networks © 2021, Mitchell J. van den Adel, Thomas A. de Vries and Dirk Pieter van Donk.

Understanding the impact of port disruptions and strengthening the system's resilience are critical to ensuring global energy trade. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for assessing the resilience of the LNG transport network. First, we construct a directed and weighted network model of the LNG transport system, and apply multidimensional centrality measures to evaluate the importance of individual ports. Next, we assess changes in the network structure caused by intentional port node disruptions, employing a Bow-tie network structure analysis. Additionally, we introduce a novel weighted network efficiency metric that incorporates link directionality and weight to assess the static resilience of the network. Furthermore, we develop an SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) transmission model that integrates relative weighted influence metrics for each port to showcase the dynamic spread of risk following a disruption at a port node. Finally, a dynamic resilience assessment framework leverages several key metrics to enhance a better understanding of the resilience of critical LNG transit ports. Our modeling methodology and evaluation framework offer a theoretical foundation for stakeholders to mitigate unexpected risks and safeguard against the diffusion of disruption risk. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

The studied supply chain faces two major risks: disruption of suppliers and tough competition from competitors. Any disruption in upstream level of the supply chain leads to an inability to meet demand downstream and causes market share to be lost to the competitors. For such a setting, a resilient topology is redesigned that can recover from and react quickly to any disruptive incidents. To this aim, we speculate there are three policies that can be used to mitigate the disruption risk, namely keeping emergency stock at the retailers, reserving back-up capacity at the suppliers, and multiple-sourcing. The problem is addressed using a mixed integer non-linear model to find the most profitable network and mitigation policies. We design a piecewise linear method to solve the model. Based on the data extracted from an automotive supply chain, practical insights of the research are extracted in a controlled experiment. Our analysis suggests that implementing risk mitigation policies not only work to the advantage of the supply chain by sustaining and improving its market share but also benefit customers by stabilizing retail prices in the market. Using the case study, we analyze the contribution of each risk strategy in stabilizing the supply chain's profit, market share, and retail price. Our analysis reveals that downstream “emergency stock” is the most preferable risk mitigation strategy if suppliers are unreliable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such a fact has motivated academics and practitioners to pay more attention to the supply chain resilience. This paper reports on designing a resilient supply chain under uncertain environment by an uncertain programming method. The desired resilience level against disruption is achieved with less redundancy by controlling them in the presented models. And parameter uncertainty caused by the limited historical data is also addressed using uncertainty theory. To cope with the problem's complexity, we convert the proposed models into their deterministic formulations, which can easily be solved by cplex solver. The results from sensitivity analysis demonstrate the necessity of including uncertainty during the planning phase of supply chain network design.

To mitigate the adverse consequence, we introduce proactive and reactive strategies and investigate the performance of these strategies. Considering the risk preference of decision-makers, we formulate the above problem as uncertain programming models under three different criteria (minimizing the expected cost, optimistic cost, and pessimistic cost). In the presented models, the side consequences and ripple effects of major disruptions are quantified by the facility capacity loss, production cost variation, and demand shift using uncertainty theory since disruption-related data are limited. Then, the developed models are converted into crisp deterministic ones with the aid of inverse distributions. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments based on a real-world geographic data set of China to illustrate the validity of the presented models. The comparison between resilient solutions for the resilient supply portfolios and the non-resilient solutions with no measures available demonstrates the effectiveness of developed strategies in mitigating the ripple effects. Confronted with uncertainty of production cost, decision-makers are advised to adopt the reactive strategy, rather than the proactive strategy. © (2024), American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

This study explores the interplay between supply chain risk management (SCRM), supply chain resilience (SCR), and sustainability efforts (SE) within the context of Malaysia’s priority manufacturing sectors—namely aerospace, chemicals, electrical and electronics (E&E), pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Employing a quantitative research approach, data were collected from 360 firms, and the hypothesized relationships were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings confirm that effective SCRM practices significantly enhance SCR across all sectors, with the E&E industry exhibiting the strongest relationship due to its reliance on globalized networks. Furthermore, SCR positively influences supply chain performance (SCP), highlighting its critical role in maintaining operational efficiency, delivery reliability, and customer satisfaction during disruptions. The study also reveals a nuanced moderating role of SE on the SCRM-SCR relationship, with significant effects observed in the aerospace sector, underscoring the sector-specific dynamics of resilience-building efforts. This research offers one of the first empirical assessments of these dynamics across Malaysia’s most strategic manufacturing industries, providing sector-specific insights aligned with the country’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030.

The goal of this study was to identify food system vulnerabilities, and elements contributing to vulnerabilities and propose practical interventions to increase food system resilience to climate change. This study concentrated on the upcountry vegetable supply chains. Heavy rain and landslides were identified as the key climatic hazards affecting upcountry vegetable-producing districts Nuwara Eliya and Badulla. Severe adverse climate events have affected vegetable production and post-harvest handling in both districts. There was a significant correlation between the severity of the climate hazard and vegetable production. The case study conducted with upcountry vegetable farmers and supply chain actors confirmed these findings. In general, the climate change adaptation measures along the supply chain were limited. The research reveals an association between climate hazards and agricultural production and distribution networks.

Risk conductors, either industrial or operational, are the dispersal agents of geographically centered, physical, or logical impacts. Critical infrastructures may transmit an impact from one enterprise to another throughout an economy. Operational risk conductors—HF and ICT—transmit horizontally within an enterprise from one business unit to another, potentially amplifying internal incidents from manageable to crisis/disaster proportions. Operational risk conductors may also transmit vertically, away from the enterprise up to the client base and downwards into the supply chain, transmitting impacts to both customers and partners/suppliers. Operational risk conductors are not necessarily a new phenomena, but they have taken on considerably greater significance under the rapid convergence of information and communication assets to Internet Protocol (IP), which has catalyzed a feedback-loop between HF and ICT. As an incident typically possesses both HF and ICT impacts, HF and ICT in turn impact each other, multiplying the scope and scale of the impact. In addition to presenting a framework for understanding and managing operational risks and resiliency, this paper proposes a cause-and-effect relationship between IP convergence and the materialization of operational risk conductors. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, little is known about cities’ vulnerability to climate-related food supply shocks. Using data-driven and network-based approaches, we determine the vulnerability of cities in the United States to domestic drought-related food shocks. Our vulnerability framework integrates key traits of a social-ecological system’s response to hazards: resilience, exposure, and sensitivity to disruption. We find that vulnerability varies considerably across cities, with western cities showing higher vulnerability than eastern cities (56% versus 47%; p < 0.001). It tends to be high in western cities because of high supply chain exposure to water stress and high urban food insecurity. Moreover, we find that southern cities show higher vulnerability than their northern counterparts, primarily due to disparities in food insecurity. Using the unprecedented 2012 U.S. drought as a case study, we show that high-vulnerability cities are associated with a higher risk of simultaneous food shocks and greater food supply losses than low-vulnerability cities. Our vulnerability framework can help inform climate adaptation interventions for food system security in urban-rural interactions. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd."

It addresses disaster events causing demand uncertainty without relying on precise probability distributions. A demand-based backup assignment strategy is proposed to strengthen the supply chain against disruptions. An environmental penalty cost is also integrated into the network design for emission mitigation. The study introduces a novel BSC design combining resilience, risk management, and environmental assessment under data ambiguity. First, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed using the mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure. Then, to tackle the ambiguity in the probability distribution of demand, a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model based on the worst-case mean-CVaR is developed. The box and polyhedral ambiguity sets are used to model uncertainty in DRO. Computational results show that DRO models lead to more conservative supply chain decisions, preventing higher-than-expected costs. The demand-based backup strategy strengthens the BSC against disruptions, and environmental integration adds significant value to carbon emission reduction. © 2025 The Authors.

Such decisions are difficult in this environment as managers encounter uncertainty and risks. The study investigates establishing or moving distribution facilities in the global supply chain by considering costs, fulfilment, trade uncertainties, risks under environmental trade-offs and disruptive technologies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines the possibilities and probabilistic scenarios for a supply chain network by proposing the novel Robust Optimisation and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (ROMILP) method developed under the potential uncertainty of demand while considering the costs associated with a four-tier supply chain network. ROMILP has been solved in a real-time logistics environment by applying a case study approach. Findings: The solution is obtained using an exact solution approach and provides optimality in all tested market scenarios along the proposed global logistics corridor. A sensitivity analysis examines potential facility location scenarios in a global supply chain context. Research limitations/implications: Logistics managers can apply the ROMILP model to test the cost-benefit trade-offs against their facility location and relocation decisions while operating under uncertainty. Future research is proposed to extend the literature by applying data from the OBOR logistics corridor. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine sustainable dimensions along the global logistics corridor and investigate the global container traffic perspective. The study also adds value to the Middle East logistics corridor regarding facility location decisions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In the past decade, the explosion of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G telecommunication infrastructure has created a sustained demand for semiconductors that is reshaping every industry on its path to digitization and automation. We first characterize the supply chain of semiconductors, which over time have been honed to deliver maximum efficiency and speed, and we examine the drivers of past disruptions, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, natural hazards, and increasing geopolitical tensions between China and the West. Second, we present the rationale for resiliency management in this critical sector by probing what countries and companies plan to do given these disruptions. Finally, we are examining the role of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), spatial analysis, and AI in semiconductors supply chain management. While the specific tools and analytics for supply chain analysis remain an open question for researchers and managers, in order to model, predict, and plan for larger scale disruptions, such as pandemics, they definitely will rely heavily on data-driven approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The research article is commenced by executing an encyclopedic review of earlier research to ascertain the distinctive traits of service-oriented manufacturing supply chains and identify prevalent risks. Secondly, an empirical study in the construction field, amongst the industry hardest struck in the mist of the COVID-19 epidemic, is conducted to thoroughly inspect the resonant effect of these risks on service-oriented manufacturing supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, to validate the resonant effect mechanism, a thorough assessment is undertaken by juxtaposing theoretical model to a newly constructed comparative model that encompasses the single effects of risks on supply chain performance. Findings: 63% variance of service-oriented manufacturing supply chain performance was showcased by the resonant effect model, compared with 46.3% in the comparative model. Moreover, each risk exerts a more glaringly significant impact on supply chain performance, asserting the mechanism of the resonant influence. Another noteworthy result involves the demand risk possessing a low effect on supply chain performance, thus emphasising the superiority of service-oriented manufacturing supply chains. Research limitations/implications: Future research endeavours should hinge on the optimal “resonant” model explosion, thereby foreseeing and alleviating worst-case scenarios to guarantee the robustness and resilience of supply chain networks. Practical implications: Indubitably, reducing the intensity of the resonant effect revolves around lowering the coefficient of “a,” thereby restricting/eliminating the link among risks. Therefore, the suggested resonant impact model might thus serve as “a road map”. In light of the aforementioned considerations, it is advisable that supply chain executives employ supply chain management tactics namely avoidance, prediction, and postponement, but only after meticulous consideration the costs and benefits of adopting such strategies. Originality/value: The service-oriented manufacturing supply chain features and advantages have been analysed and explained throughout the article. The data gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic is a captivating and topical point of this paper. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Counterfeiting and in-field tampering of PCBs have become significant security concerns in the semiconductor industry as a result of increasing untrusted entities in the supply chain. These counterfeit components may result in performance degradation, profit reduction, and reputation risk for the manufacturers. While Integrated Circuit (IC) level authentication using physical unclonable functions (PUFs) has been widely investigated, countermeasures at the PCB level are scarce. These approaches either suffer from significant overhead issues, or opportunistic counterfeiters can breach them like clockwork. Besides, they cannot be extended to system-level (both chip and PCB together), and their applications are also limited to a specific purpose (i.e., either counterfeiting or tampering). In this article, we introduce SILVerIn, a novel systematic approach to verify the authenticity of all chips used in a PCB as well as the board for combating attacks such as counterfeiting, cloning, and in-field malicious modifications. We develop this approach by utilizing the existing boundary scan architecture (BSA) of modern ICs and PCBs. As a result, its implementation comes at a negligible (g1/40.5%) hardware overhead. SILVerIn is integrated into a PCB design during the manufacturing phase. We implement our technique on a custom hardware platform consisting of an FPGA and a microcontroller. We incorporate the industry-standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface to transmit test data into the BSA and perform hands-on measurement of supply current at both chip and PCB levels on 20 boards. We reconstruct these current values to digital signatures that exhibit high uniqueness, robustness, and randomness features. Our approach manifests strong reproducibility of signatures at different supply voltage levels, even with a low-resolution measurement setup. SILVerIn also demonstrates a high resilience against machine learning-based modeling attacks, with an average prediction accuracy of g1/451%. Finally, we conduct intentional alteration experiments by replacing the on-board FPGA to replicate the scenario of PCB tampering, and the results indicate successful detection of in-field modifications in a PCB. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

Traditional supply chain management methods, which often rely on static, linear models, are insufficient to address these challenges. Digital twin technology offers a transformative solution by creating a real-time, dynamic replica of the physical supply chain. This chapter explores how digital twin technology, integrated within a smart supply chain, enhances supply chain resilience across three key dimensions: readiness, response, and recovery. By continuously mapping the upstream, midstream, and downstream components of a supply chain, organizations can anticipate risks, act swiftly during disruptions, and recover efficiently to maintain operational continuity. The primary objective of this chapter is to demonstrate how smart supply chain mapping, powered by digital twin technology, can significantly improve organizational resilience. The chapter also explores the prerequisites for implementing real-time digital mapping, including the technological infrastructure and organizational readiness required to support such initiatives. The chapter employs a qualitative approach, drawing on a existing literature and reports, along with the authors’ understanding of emerging technologies in supply chain management. Furthermore, this chapter calls for future research to investigate the feasibility of implementing real-time, dynamic digital twin mapping in complex, multi-tiered global supply chains. As supply chains extend beyond immediate tiers, mapping each node becomes increasingly challenging due to the complexity and breadth of the network. Feasibility studies are crucial in evaluating the scalability and applicability of digital twins in diverse industries, ensuring that the technology can handle the vast amounts of data and the complexities of global supply networks. Future research should focus on overcoming these challenges and unlocking the full potential of digital twin technology for enhancing supply chain resilience. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

The conventional supply chain models fail to consider the geographical differences in traffic, infrastructure, and inventory availability, which limits the economic performance and developmental equity. This study determines the areas that require the most optimization and investment by combining variables of spatial data that comprise shipping cost, traffic congestion, inventory levels, and disruption risk into a composite Cost-Time-Risk index. The study uses geospatial mapping and multi-objective modelling applications to review logistical inefficiency and model interventions that are suitable for the regional requirements of logistics. The results indicate a strong contrast between congested high-risk areas and other regions with great potential in terms of optimization. Besides the identification of bottlenecks that are critical, the analysis also offers practical information regarding the routing strategy, stocking policy, and capacity planning. The research highlights the tactical imperative to abandon centralized, one-size-fits-all logistics models and instead introduce regionally adaptive, resiliency-based models. Going ahead, the research proposes the inclusion of artificial intelligence-based tools and real-time data analytics so as to have dynamic and self-optimizing supply chains. Lastly, it demands coordinated regional planning, which places infrastructure development, policy formulation, and technological advancement on the same platform, so that spatial optimization turns out to be a driver of inclusive growth and long-term supply chain resilience. © 2025, Green Publication.

This approach allows finding the more important supply risks within global supply chains and over different time horizons, which leads to fine-tuned insights that can help creating resilient supply networks. To this end, the SPOTTER approach assesses overall supply disruption impacts for complete supply chains and supply disruption hotspots separately in the short- and medium-term. The overall impacts and hotspots are evaluated from global and country-specific supply disruption events and aggregated into the two categories of 'cost variability' and 'limited availability'. Scores of these impacts and hotspots are calculated by multiplying resource, material and product flows with respective characterization factors, which are case-specific and are defined by diverse indicators of supply disruption probability and vulnerability. The article provides an overview of the SPOTTER approach and its rationale by explaining the selection and use of indicators to define characterization factors and by describing the procedure to calculate the overall impact and hotspot scores. Furthermore, it presents an implementation procedure for the practical application of the approach. Finally, it highlights the data availability and methodological issues that currently affect the implementation practicability and the representativeness of the SPOTTER approach to describe global supply risks in detail and refers to the need for future research and development on this topic. © 2022 The Authors

Since the 1990s, geopolitical risks have been crucial in the LNG supply chain. However, existing research inadequately addresses the impact of major geopolitical events, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict, on LNG maritime networks. This study utilized 2021–2022 Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to create a global LNG maritime network, including ports and chokepoints, to assess changes in structure and resilience during the Russia–Ukraine conflict. We also simulated changes in network resilience under various attack scenarios. The findings indicate that the Russia–Ukraine conflict has impacted the direction and volume of LNG flows. Structural changes were observed, including changes in the weighted degree of nodes and the composition of port communities. In 2022, the network demonstrated dynamic resilience, invulnerability, and recoverability changes, with noticeable self-healing properties. However, these capabilities were lower than those in 2021. Intentional attacks on maritime chokepoints, such as the Strait of Malacca, result in a much faster decline in network resilience than random attacks. These findings suggest that the Russia–Ukraine conflict has altered the resilience and structure of LNG maritime networks. Countries heavily dependent on LNG should prioritize expanding their LNG-receiving terminals and diversifying their LNG sourcing strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

This triad has a common second-tier supplier as the disruption source, which gives us the tetradic context. The goal is to advance the knowledge on how a first-tier supplier's resilience against lower-tier disruptive events can be developed through horizontally connecting with the other first-tier supplier and how the buyer can benefit from its first-tier suppliers' resilience capability. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 33 triads was collected and analyzed. Findings: As predicted, coopetition between two first-tier suppliers increases the first-tier supplier's capability to be resilient to disruptive events emanating from a lower tier source. However, contrary to initial theorization, the first-tier supplier's resilience capability affects the buyer's performance during disruptive events negatively. With increasing buyer–supplier social bonds, this negative relationship can partly be alleviated. Research limitations/implications: Analyzing resilience within a triad to a disruption in the tetradic context reveals unexpected dynamics. Individual supplier's resilience may have a negative impact on the buyer's resilience in certain disruption events. Practical implications: The buyer can increase collective suppliers' resilience through establishing horizontal links. To prevent becoming a victim of the supplier's resilience in the event of a second-tier disruption, a buyer needs to become a member of the supplier's relational network. Originality/value: We propose that resilience can rest with the suppliers. This observation has implications for the buyer when selecting and coordinating suppliers. Further, it considers a context beyond a triad by venturing into the tetradic context. We anticipate more studies in tetrads in future and this study can serve as a bridge. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use long-term time series of secondary data to assemble a “basket” of key indicators that are relevant to the business context within which global supply chains operate. The authors also report on five years of feedback gained from presentations of the SCVI to scholars and practitioners. Findings: Volatility has reduced from record levels experienced during the global financial crises, yet remains at levels considerably higher than prior to the crisis, with no sign of a return to the more stable conditions that prevailed when many current supply chain networks were designed. Research limitations/implications: The authors reaffirm that new mental models are needed which embrace volatility as a factor in supply chain design, rather than seek to eradicate it in supply chain operations. Traditional static “network optimisation” based on a simple definition of low unit cost seems no longer appropriate under conditions of persistent volatility. Practical implications: The authors provide a conceptual link of volatility, risk and cost in the supply chain, and outline how firms can develop a supply chain strategy by managing their exposure to volatility. Originality/value: The authors challenge the common assumption that volatility invariably leads to risk and higher cost in the supply chain. Instead the authors argue that the supply chain structure can mitigate the exposure to supply chain risk. The authors introduce the concepts of recovery and resilience cost within a framework designed to help firms manage volatility-induced risk by minimising the adverse cost implications of volatility in their supply chains. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

Existing studies often ignore the monthly variation in water quality and lack an integrated prefectural-level assessment of quantity–quality–environmental flow requirement (EFR) water scarcity. Moreover, conventional methods for estimating water scarcity risk depend on subjective assumptions and ignore adaptive behaviors, limiting accuracy. This study developed a multiagent complex network model integrating monthly data on water quality from 3,646 national monitoring stations, municipal water use inventories, and EFR constraints to assess water scarcity-induced supply chain losses. Findings show that incorporating water quality restrictions increases water-scarce cities from 81 to 89, the shortage volume by 17.7%, and losses by 5%. Several cities, such as Lanzhou, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan, have experienced a localized water scarcity with significant impacts. Water quality-related losses are concentrated in the industrialized northern plains. We evaluated three management strategies: water quality improvement, reclaimed water use, and the Water Diversion Project. Their combined implementation reduced water scarcity in 62 cities and generated benefits of 39–40.7 billion Chinese Yuan. This study quantifies the impacts of water scarcity on cross-regional and cross-sectoral supply chains and provides essential evidence for guiding sustainable and resilient water management. © 2025 American Chemical Society

Supply chain resilience (SCRES) constitutes the network ability to recover after and survive during such unexpected events. To enhance the understanding of SCRES as a system-wide quality, this study tests a comprehensive SCRES model with data from multiple industries. Design/methodology/approach: The study proposes a theoretical framework conceptualizing SCRES as system quality, extending the classical proactive/reactive taxonomy by multiple system states consisting of the supply system properties, behaviors and responses to disruptions. Underlying hypotheses were tested using an online survey. The sample consists of 219 responses from German industries. Maximum likelihood structural equation modeling (ML-SEM) and moderation analysis were used for analyzing the survey data. The study was particularly designed to elaborate on supply chain theory. Findings: Two pathways of parallel SCRES building were identified: proactive preparedness via anticipation and reactive responsiveness via agility. Both system responses are primarily built simultaneously rather than successively. The present study further provides empirical evidence on the central role of visibility and velocity in achieving comprehensive SCRES, while flexibility only exerts short-term support after a disruption. The study additionally points to potential “spillover effects” such as the vital role of proactive SCRES in achieving reactive responsiveness. Originality/value: The present study confirms and expands existing theories on SCRES. While stressing the multidimensionality of SCRES, it theorizes the (inter-)temporal evolution of a system and offers practical guidelines for SCRES building in various industrial contexts. It thus supports the transformation toward more resilient and viable supply chains, contributing to the increasing efforts of middle-range theory building to achieve an overarching theory. The study also points to potential future research avenues. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Design/methodology/approach: From a review of the literature the conceptual domain of SCRES is defined and the proposed relationships with SCRM and SCV are derived. Data from a longitudinal case study with three supply chains are presented to explore the relationship between the concepts in the context of the global financial crisis. Findings: The empirical data provide support for a positive impact of supply chain risk (SCR) effect and knowledge management on SCRES and from SCRES on SCV. SCR effect and knowledge management seem to enhance the SCRES by improving the flexibility, visibility, velocity and collaboration capabilities of the supply chain. Thereby, they decrease the SCV in a disruptive risk event. The positive effects manifest themselves in upstream supplier networks of supply chains as well as in distribution channels to the customers. Research limitations/implications: The recession caused by the financial crisis has illustrated the importance of SCRES in today's interdependent global economy vividly. However, the concept is still in its infancy and has not received the same attention as its counterparts SCRM and SCV. The study confirms the benefit of resilient supply chains and outlines future research needs. Practical implications: The paper identifies which supply chain capabilities can support the containment of disruptions and how these capabilities can be supported by effective SCRM. Originality/value: To date, there has been no empirical study which has investigated supply chain resilience in a disruptive global event. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Improving the supply chain resilience (SCR) of PC has become a consensus for breaking this deadlock. Existing studies predominantly investigate SCR from a supply chain vulnerability (SCV) or capability dimension, ignoring the complex interactions involved. This study adopted the two-mode social network analysis (SNA) to explore the embedded interactions between supply chain stakeholder capabilities (SCSCs) and SCVs on SCR enhancement. Interactions between SCSCs and between SCVs were also analyzed using one-mode SNA. Nine SCSCs and 30 SCVs were first identified through literature reviews and expert interviews. Network data were then obtained by a questionnaire survey in China. An SCSCs-SCVs network was subsequently developed and further projected into two one-mode networks. A series of network indicators were finally calculated to reveal the underlying interactions. A strategy framework was finally proposed to improve the SCR of PC. Findings indicate that emergency response and general contractor control are the most critical SCSCs for enhancing SCR. Mitigating an SCV requires the collaboration of about four SCSCs. The cumulative contribution of the top four SCSCs to the SCV mitigation ranges from 48.6% to 94.5%. Seven critical SCVs are identified, such as improper and change design and poor planning and scheduling of on-site, which play significant roles in bridging SCVs' interactions. Also, SCSCs demonstrate various roles in their interactions, including the most efficient emergency response. This study innovatively conducts a quantitative analysis of the complex interactions embedded in SCR, providing theoretical support for effectively and efficiently improving the SCR of PC. Practical implications could be drawn from this study to help the government and industry stakeholders improve the supply chain performance of PC projects. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The academic literature has well discussed the causes of supply chain (SC) risk events, the impact of SC disruptions, and associated plans for SC resilience. However, the literature remains fragmented on the role of two fundamental elements in achieving SC resilience: the firm's size and the firm's industry as firms' contingent factors. Therefore, it is important to investigate and highlight SC resilience differences by size and industry type to establish more resilient firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building upon the contingent resource-based view of the firm, the authors posit that organizational factors such as size and industry sector have important roles in developing organizational resilience capabilities. This systematic literature review and analysis is based on the structural and systematic analysis of high-ranked peer-reviewed journal papers from January 2000 to June 2021 collected through three global scientific databases (i.e. ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar) using relevant keywords. Findings: This systematic literature review of 230 high-quality articles shows that SC risk events can be categorized into demand, supply, organizational, operational, environmental, and network/control risk events. This study suggests that the SC resilience plans developed by startups, small and mdium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and large organizations are not necessarily the same as those of large enterprises. While collaboration and networking and risk management are the most crucial resilience capabilities for all firms, applying lean and quality management principles and utilizing information technology are more crucial for SMEs. For large firms, knowledge management and contingency planning are more important. Originality/value: This study provides a comprehensive review of the literature on SC resilience plans across different organizational sizes and industries, offering new insights into the nature and dynamics of startups', SMEs', and large enterprises' SC resilience in different industries. The study highlights the need for further investigation of SC risk and resilience for startups, SMEs, and different industries on a more detailed level using empirical data. This study’s findings have important implications for researchers and practitioners and guide the development of effective SC resilience strategies for different types of firms. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

An empirically grounded framework operationalizes the concept of social–ecological resilience by expounding resilience capabilities across phases of the CAS adaptive cycle. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a qualitative multiple case study approach. It draws on the case of the Australian Defence Manufacturing SN (ADM SN) during COVID-19 disruptions. A total of 28 interviews with senior decision makers from 17 companies, complemented by 5 interviews with the Australian Defence SC organizations and secondary data analysis, support the findings. Findings: Individual organizations’ SC visibility and flexibility enabled by effective risk management and collaboration enhance the ability of the SN to anticipate and prepare for disruption. At the same time, the strength of SC relationships reduces resilience. SN disruption response velocity is enabled by inventory redundancy, process flexibility at the organizational level and visibility and collaboration at the SC level. Institutional support at the national industry level, development of value-adding capabilities and manufacturing process flexibility at the organizational level enhances the SN’s ability to re-organize. The transition from hierarchical to decentralized collaborative governance enhances SN resilience. Practical implications: From a practitioner’s perspective, the findings highlight the need to embrace a broader view of SC beyond immediate tiers. Decision-makers in multinational companies must recognize the long-term impact of their procurement decisions on the supplier ecosystem. Developing local supplier capabilities rather than relying on established global SCs will pay off with future resilience. It, however, demands substantial investment and radical changes across all SC tiers. The lesson for smaller firms is not to over-rely on the existing relationships with supply partners. Although trust-based relationships and collaboration are essential, over-commitment can be counterproductive during global disruptions. With a lack of visibility and control over the SC, operational flexibility is critical for small firms to adapt to shifts in supply and demand. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this empirical research is one of the first attempts to operationalize the social–ecological perspective of SN resilience. Evidence-based theoretical propositions contribute to the emerging conversation about the CAS nature of resilience by demonstrating the multi-level effects of resilience capabilities. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We construct supply networks using data from the top five clients and suppliers disclosed in the annual reports of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2022, and measures node-level supply network structure. Our findings indicate that improved supply network structure reduces firms’ systemic tail risks, primarily through information efficiency and risk diversification mechanisms. The effect is more pronounced with heightened analyst and media attention, superior corporate disclosures, closer proximity to clients or suppliers, and fewer financial constraints.

The benefit of renewable energy is that it decreases the dependence on conventional fuel, and minimizes carbon emissions. However, the commercial feasibility of multi-biofuel production poses a major challenge. A resilient and cost-efficient biofuel supply chain network is essential for commercialization. Furthermore, disruption risks arise from operational downtime, labor strikes, natural disasters, and uncertainty embedded in the data compromise the effectiveness of tactical and strategic level supply chain planning. In line with the aforementioned requirements, a multi-biofuel supply chain network model that reduces the total system cost and accounts for both disruption and operational risks is proposed. The proposed model determines the optimal production–distribution quantities and supports facility location and capacity decisions against multiple supply and demand interruption scenarios. The lead time crashing cost is utilized here to reduce the lead time, which increases because of transportation disruptions. To decrease energy expenses and carbon emissions, a variable production rate is applied for creating an economic way to advance the manufacturing industry. The model aims to show bioenergy's effect on making a sustainable multi-biofuel supply chain network. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is seen that by utilizing the presented method, the production cost of biofuels is significantly reduced through minimized energy consumption and carbon emissions. Moreover, the impact of critical parameters on the total system cost is explained through sensitivity analysis and graphical representations. The effort provides a systematic guideline for designing various environmental, economic, and social aspects of a sustainable supply chain network for bioenergy under minimized consumption. Multi-biofuel producers, distributors, investors, and the regulators surely be benefitted from the proposed model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

Systemic risks have emerged from the decisions of individual firms, e.g., outsourcing and buffer reduction, and are now beyond their control. This paper aims to identify appropriate approaches to mitigating those risks. Design/methodology/approach: Systemic risks require analyzing supply chains beyond a dyadic perspective. This study approaches the problem through the lenses of complex systems and network theories. Drawing on the lessons learned from other systemic-risk-prone systems, e.g. energy and financial networks, both in research and practice, this study analyzes the adequate level of governance to monitor and manage systemic risks in supply chains. Findings: The authors argue that governance institutions should be mandated to overview and reduce systemic risks in supply chains from the top down, as central bankers do for the financial system. Using firm-level data and tools from network analysis and system dynamics, they could quantify systemic risks, identify risk-prone interconnections in supply chains and design mitigating measures. This top-down approach would complement the bottom-up supply chain management approach and could help insurers design policies for contingent business interruptions. Originality/value: Instead of looking at supply chains purely from the firms’ angle, the perspective of insurers and governments is brought in to reflect on the governance of risks. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This may increase the risk of supply chain disruption in low-income countries that rely heavily on grain imports. This study used production and trade data for wheat, barley and maize from 1995 to 2021 to construct longitudinal trade networks. On this basis, a cascading failure network model of shock propagation was used to identify the direct or indirect dependence of other countries on grain exported from Russia and Ukraine and the impact caused by trade shocks. The results revealed that the interruption of grain exports from Russia and Ukraine has resulted in an increasing impact on the global grain trade year by year and that the wheat trade is the most vulnerable to shock propagation, but it is also the most resilient. Russia and Ukraine interrupt exports of grain, causing more than 50% reduction in direct imports to 30 countries, including Eritrea, Seychelles, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. A shock propagation model that considers indirect dependence yields divergent results, with lower middle income (LM) countries in North Africa, Southeast Asia and West Asia facing supply shocks from reduced imports because they are unable to fully exploit the trade channels to balance grain supply and demand. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, this indirect dependence on imports is more prominent. It is worth noting that Eastern and Southern European countries often act as intermediaries to spread shocks during cascading failures. In the process of shock propagation, the main suppliers of grain include the United States, Canada, France, Argentina and Brazil. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the import demand faced by Australia increased significantly. We also examined how nodal characteristics relate to shock propagation dynamics and country vulnerability, finding that high import diversity, low import dependence and regional characteristics are effective in buffering countries from supply shocks. This study contributes to our understanding of the external supply risks for grain arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict in a pandemic context, highlights the issue of accessibility in food security and provides trade policy recommendations to mitigate national vulnerability to food insecurity, thereby creating a resilient food trade system. © 2023, The Author(s).

Substantial economic losses and social impacts are caused once natural disasters or man-made disruptions attack the CISs. As a “resilient city” has become an essential theme of communities’ sustainable development, research on resilience and its practice in industries boost the CISs’ capacity to respond and adapt to changing environments. From the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection, this study screened 1,247 scientific articles related to resilience in CISs and conducted a bibliometric analysis to investigate the evolution and future potential in this field. Topic visualized networks were constructed for CIS resilience using CiteSpace, a dedicated tool for visualizing and analyzing trends and patterns in scientific literature. The results demonstrate collaborative research networks among countries, institutions, main scholar/group networks, and leading journals publishing CIS resilience work. This study also explained how the research interest evolved over the last 20 years and found the current frontiers pointing to “power systems resilience” and “supply chain resilience.” The reasons were discussed subsequently from the perspectives of the influence that natural hazards (based on the EM-DAT data) and government policies have upon CISs’ resilience work. © 2024 Society for Risk Analysis.

In recent years, the frequency of emergencies and geopolitical risks has caused countries to face great challenges in the energy supply chain, making it urgent to establish new trade partnerships to ensure energy security. For example, in the case of Russia, its LNG exports to Europe have significantly declined after the conflict, while exports to the Asian market have grown substantially, indicating a realignment of trade flows. Therefore, this study analyzes the evolution of network characteristics under different risk scenarios by constructing an LNG trade dependency network model. Specifically, based on data from 2013 to 2022, this paper examines the dynamic evolution of the LNG trade dependency network in terms of connectivity, cohesion, and efficiency, using three core indicators: network density, average clustering coefficient, and average path length. It is found that driven by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the LNG trade network exhibits a more cohesive and efficient structure. Major importing countries diversify risks and strengthen supply chain resilience by improving network density and clustering coefficient. This finding not only provides theoretical support for understanding the evolution mechanism of international energy trade dependency networks but also serves as a reference for countries to develop diversified trade strategies and achieve energy supply security in response to unexpected geopolitical risks. © 2025 The Authors

Understanding these vulnerabilities is critical for mitigating disaster risks. Previous studies often overlooked the essential connections between rural and urban regions. This research examines how rural-urban connections change following a flood event, what factors influence these interactions, and how they contribute to the vulnerability of rural areas after a flood in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The study employed convenience and snowball sampling techniques to select 35 respondents with relevant disaster management and recovery expertise. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and personal observations to ensure a diverse range of participants' responses. The thematic data analysis method was chosen to highlight the significance of participants' experiences. The study findings revealed that the rural population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province heavily depends on nearby cities for essential resources and services (food, healthcare, and employment opportunities) significantly when local resources are depleted due to flooding. Floods caused serious repercussions to the rural-urban linkages through people (e.g., human mobility patterns, evacuation and displacement, and migration), information (early warning signals, post-disaster information support, financial aid coordination and technical assistance for reconstruction, health and sanitation management, logistics and supply chain restoration), Finance (resources inflow, and insurance coverage), and goods and relief services (urban areas as coordination hubs for disaster response, service delivery and specialized support systems, long-term recovery and resilience building, and economic interdependence and systemic vulnerabilities). However, this dependence diminishes when villages become self-reliant in accessing information, credit, goods, and market services. Rural areas are more vulnerable due to their weaker infrastructure, limited institutional capacity, and dependence on natural resources. In contrast, urban areas encounter challenges such as overcrowding, resource allocation, and maintaining service continuity when accommodating displaced populations. This study also identifies the primary attributes, including social (demography-population size, age, gender, health status, education, and social networks), economic (income levels and rural-urban connectivity, occupational sector and interaction patterns, income inequality and migration dynamics, occupation-specific vulnerability profiles), Institutional (strengthening rural-urban resilience to floods, local governance and flood risk management initiatives, enhancing emergency response and community preparedness, institutional coordination and disaster risk reduction strategies, leveraging technology and early warning systems) and environmental dimensions (river bodies, soil quality, erosion level, and water availability) which also affected the influence of rural-urban connections and their vulnerability to flood events across the selected districts. The current study findings offer important insights for policymakers to create integrated flood risk management strategies that strengthen rural infrastructure, improve early warning systems, and expand financial inclusion, stressing the significance of coordinated rural-urban disaster planning to direct displacement, guarantee fair resource allocation, and foster long-lasting resilience. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the economic resilience of Kosovo, Belgium, and Azerbaijan, which face diverse geopolitical challenges due to their differing geographical positions, economic structures, and international trade networks. The research aims to identify key factors influencing economic sustainability in the face of geopolitical disruptions and propose strategies for mitigating risks. A comparative analysis was conducted using qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the impact of geopolitical conflicts, sanctions, and trade restrictions on global supply chains. The study integrates statistical trade data, policy analyses, and case studies to evaluate the geopolitical pressures affecting logistics and international commerce. Findings reveal that economic stability and resilience to geopolitical risks depend on a country’s ability to adapt through infrastructure development, trade diversification, and international cooperation. Kosovo struggles with trade limitations due to partial international recognition and regional instability. Belgium faces supply chain disruptions due to Brexit and EU sanctions against Russia but benefits from strong institutional frameworks. Azerbaijan, while strategically positioned as an energy supplier, must navigate regional tensions and shifting global trade alliances. This study provides novel insights by comparing countries with different economic structures and geopolitical vulnerabilities, highlighting diverse adaptation strategies. The results underscore the need for proactive policy measures, investment in infrastructure, and diversification of trade partnerships to strengthen resilience. These findings offer valuable implications for policymakers and businesses seeking to mitigate geopolitical risks and enhance global supply chain stability. © 2025 by the author(s).

Seven academic databases: Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar were systematically searched from 2015 to March 2025, and screening followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Of 3,716 retrieved records, 109 studies met the inclusion criteria. Bibliometric mapping (VOSviewer) and qualitative synthesis identified five thematic clusters: (i) biogas process safety, (ii) IoT integration and renewable-energy, (iii) optimisation and supply-chain resilience, (iv) AI-driven decision-support frameworks, and (v) advanced machine-learning techniques. The analysis reveals a marked increase in publications since 2020, reflecting a shift from conceptual modelling toward applied digital risk solutions. Europe and China remain leading contributors, although collaboration networks are fragmented and methodological heterogeneity persists. Full-scale validation of AI models in operational WWTP-based biogas plants remains limited, with most studies relying on laboratory experiments, simulations, or pilot-scale data. Constraints include publication bias, database coverage, English-language restrictions, inconsistent performance metrics, and limited access to long-term Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems datasets. The review demonstrates that AI-driven methods have significant potential to improve safety, operational efficiency, and regulatory assurance in biogas facilities. However, achieving practical and scalable implementation will require rigorous multi-site validation, standardised evaluation indicators, integration of explainable AI, and alignment with plant-level risk-governance frameworks. © 2025 The Authors

However, TPLs also introduce potential security risks, as they may propagate 1-day vulnerabilities or even malicious code into apps. Moreover, certain downstream tasks, such as app clone detection, license violation identification and patch presence test, require accurate TPL detection as a prerequisite. Consequently, TPL detection has gained increasing importance over the past decade in improving maintainability and enhancing security within the software supply chain. To ensure robustness against external factors and precise vulnerability identification, modern library detection tools, in addition to recognizing TPL variety, must be resilient to code obfuscation and optimization, and must also be capable of accurately identifying library versions. Although recent studies have reported progress in addressing these issues, none have conducted a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether the proposed methods effectively overcome these challenges. Furthermore, critical aspects such as tool performance on real-world apps, as well as the generalizability of existing approaches, are frequently overlooked in current research. To gain deeper insights into TPL detection research, we conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. This study begins by summarizing the common technologies used at each stage of the TPL detection process, followed by an analysis of the prevalence of code obfuscation and optimization in real-world apps to identify key external factors that hinder effective library detection. Next, we evaluate the performance of cutting-edge tools on multiple ground-truth datasets to validate our findings. Specifically, we systematically analyze the methodologies employed by these tools, assessing their capabilities in TPL variety detection, version identification, resilience to common obfuscation and optimization techniques, and the underlying causes of their failures. Finally, we assessed the generalizability of these tools by comparing their performance across diverse datasets and validating them with real-world data. Our findings confirm that obfuscation and optimization are indeed prevalent in real-world scenarios. However, the code transformations introduced by these techniques often exceed the scope of scenarios considered in prior TPL detection studies. We also observe that even the most advanced detection features struggle to accurately differentiate between library versions. In addition to errors caused by obfuscation and optimization, overly simplistic library features can further contribute to false positives. Moreover, while most tools perform well on their own curated datasets and show reduced performance on external datasets, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios does not exhibit a substantial disparity. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of current TPL detection techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in this area. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

Wet market vendors are economically disadvantaged as the operators of small-scale businesses with limited investment and high labor costs. Nevertheless, wet market vendors continue to thrive in urban China, despite the continued expansion of supermarket chains. This article combines ethnographic data and social network analysis to examine how social networks provide wet market vendors with some important competitive advantages. The article draws on fourteen months of fieldwork in Sanya City, China, and provides an analysis of the composition, structure, and strength of the network ties of 113 wet market vendors. Vendors tend to have strong and dense ties to individuals who help them establish their businesses. Vendors also rely on strong ties with regular suppliers to help them reduce costs and ensure a regular supply of goods. These strong ties are balanced by weaker ties with a diverse range of customers, including small businesses and household consumers. A combination of both strong and weak network ties contributes to the collective resilience of wet market vendors, allowing them to confront crises, reduce risk and uncertainty, and improve performance. © 2024 The Authors.

This study delves into a particular policy enacted by the U.S. amid the U.S.-China trade war context, targeting foreign investment in China. Our focus is on examining its repercussions on the stock market of relevant high-tech industries in China, and we explore how operational leanness and operational resilience hedge the impact, as well as environmental and network factors moderate these effects based on the complex adaptive systems (CASs) perspective. This study adopts the event study method to analyze the impact of the U.S. investment restriction event in China on the shareholder value of Chinese listed firms. To test our model, we collected data from 812 Chinese listed firms. The U.S. investment restriction event adversely affects the shareholder value of targeted industries in China. Furthermore, we observe a negative correlation between operational leanness and cumulative abnormal returns, while operational resilience exhibits a positive association with cumulative abnormal returns. We also delve into the impact of demand uncertainty and betweenness centrality on these two moderating effects. Our findings reveal that demand uncertainty weakens the positive influence of operational resilience, whereas betweenness centrality strengthens it. However, neither demand uncertainty nor betweenness centrality influences the efficacy of operational leanness. This research enriches the geopolitical risk literature by focusing on a significant investment restriction act. Our study contributes to the different roles of operational leanness and resilience in mitigating geopolitical risks as well as their boundary conditions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

Resilience, a key measure of a firm’s ability to endure and adapt, strengthens traditional corporate risk management by supporting growth potential. This study aims to explore the impact of structural holes in supply chain networks on a firm’s financial resilience, offering insights into how network positioning influences firm stability. Design/methodology/approach This study constructs a decade-long supply chain network using data from Chinese A-share listed firms from 2013 to 2022 to assess each firm’s network positions and its financial resilience. The analysis focuses on structural holes and explores their effects on resilience through mechanisms like operational efficiency and financing constraints. Findings Empirical analysis indicates that firms occupying structural hole positions exhibit reduced financial resilience, driven by decreased operational efficiency and increased financing constraints. Heterogeneity analysis shows that this negative effect is more pronounced among state-owned enterprises, firms with high institutional shareholding and those with significant market advantages. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on resilience by integrating embedding theory with supply chain network analysis. It provides a micro-level perspective on supply chain resilience and practical insights for strategic planning to mitigate network-related risks. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited

The researchers examine the dependency of the tourism industry on the general preparation programs that were developed and are currently being deployed by the relevant national stakeholders and question whether instead, it should use the pandemic as a catalyst for formulating its own nuanced tourism-travel-and-hospitality-oriented strategies and procedures. Design/methodology/approach: Applying an ethnographic-based mix-methods research approach, this paper draws on insights from data compiled by fusing existing theoretical and emerging practical knowledge with empirical research (qualitative and quantitative) conducted among numerous relevant macro (governmental/centralized industry) and micro (hotels, travel and tourism operators and service providers) stakeholders as well as potential consumers. Findings: It is essential that national and local government bodies form collaborative interorganizational relationships with local stakeholders to jointly activate case-specific hospitality and travel-specific risk mitigation management strategies. Moreover, the pandemic laid bare the tentative and fragile nature of the globalized tourism industry supply and demand chains, a condition that may be remedied via a pivot toward using national or even regional supply chains and goods and service providers. Within Israel, such changes could lead to increased economic benefits that extend beyond the tourism industry to provide certain security-related benefits. Originality/value: Relating to idiosyncratic factors relevant to an Israeli cultural context, this paper uses the ethnographic field-borne familiarity of the researchers with the tourism and travel industries in Eilat and the Dead Sea to offer applicable suggestions for leveraging certain industry resources to both meet the demands of the present-day circumstances and cultivate a multifaceted organizational web of macro and micro social, economic and environmental networks so as to foster a more diversified and therefore resilient local tourism and travel economy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

A mosaic of models for producing more food in and around cities is emerging that promises shorter supply chains, increased food access, plant-based solutions and robust community resilience. Models for urban agriculture range from backyard and community gardens to rooftop farms to plant factories, representing tremendous diversity in the cropping systems, technologies, skills, and organizational forms used to grow food. Amidst this flourishing, concerns over inequitable distributions of the benefits and risks of expanding urban agriculture underscore the need to center justice in determining the right mix of models. City regions need innovative governance approaches to strategically, sustainably, and equitably manage this emerging mosaic at the city region scale and considering its full social-ecological ramifications. The JUST GROW framework addresses this need by incorporating three interlinked principles of justice into a comprehensive governance process of collective knowing, inclusive deliberation, and intentional action. We offer strategies for building collaborative capacities among community, government, and research stakeholder groups to cocreate indicators and invest in the data infrastructure needed to measure outcomes that matter for sustainability and equity. Our framework also creates a pathway to proactively construct responsibility to act on this knowledge bank by aligning authority, capacity, and motivation within representative governance networks. The long term goal of the JUST GROW framework is to build a process for food producers, urban planners, municipal agencies, community groups, and civil society organizations to help city region food systems (CRFS) better provide key benefits from urban agriculture—including positive environmental impacts, supporting vibrant food cultures, land access, livelihoods, and food security—for all people now and into the future. © © 2025 Baur, Jennings, Aliu, Calo, Farhangi, He, Kanki, Koch, Kiyoyama, Martin, Sabir, Schröter, Specht, Taylor, Treviño, Vinge and Voora.

It examines the role of blockchain adoption in mitigating such disruptions by using data from Chinese firms between 2015 and 2022 and employs textual analysis to construct indexes on firms' blockchain innovation and supply chain risk exposure. We find that firms with high supply chain risk experience a more significant reduction in formal and informal financing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, blockchain adoption helps provide more resilience to supply chain financing disruptions in the crisis by enhancing information transparency, corporate governance, and production network efficiency. Further analysis shows that the alleviation effect is heterogeneous and more pronounced for firms with private ownership and lower social trust. The main results remain consistent using alternative measures based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a large language model. Our paper highlights the importance of digital technology advancement in protecting supply chain security under crises. © 2025 The Authors

In order to uncover the multiple effects of financial squeeze, we first propose a transaction reconstruction algorithm to build an empirical data-based integrated supply chain network (ED-ISCN) with 2734 semiconductor industry companies by combining the buyer-supplier relationship data with financial statements. According to the relationship characteristics, we identify four types of company in the ED-ISCN based on supplier and consumer concentrations, including hub-like, pocket-like, fork-like and capillary-like companies. Second, to capture the multi-level and multi-faceted impacts of both financial and the derived logistics risk on the ED-ISCN, we develop an agent-based model to simulate the interactive operational processes, including order placement, delivery and payment. Finally, we comprehensively simulate and visualise the complex propagation processes of joint risks. The results show that the impact of financial squeezes not only has the obvious ripple effect, but also exhibits the correlation, duality, and threshold effects. Furthermore, we identify the differentiated responses of various companies and the specific propagation patterns of financial and logistics risks. In addition, this paper provides more nuanced implications to help companies and policymakers better deal with financial squeezes. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The visibility of tier-1 suppliers gives only a narrow view of the entire picture. Methodology/results: This work expands on applying the Nexus Supplier Index [1] using a data-driven approach that deviates from the traditional analysis. It relies on the network topology, leveraging graph centralities. Data collection started with 40 focal companies representing 24 industries, 14 clusters, different sectors, and sizes, generating $1.7 T in revenue and 2.3 M jobs. We collected ∼16,000 data points covering upstream and downstream supply chains, the most extensive application of the NSI reported in the literature. We calculated different node centralities for the focal companies and all companies in their supply networks to increase supply chain visibility to key worldwide companies. We propose improvements for identifying hidden critical suppliers (HCS) within the network that, when combined, provide visibility of depths up to 11 tiers. Managerial implications: This work illustrates the results of a partnership between academia with governmental and non-governmental agencies in a data-driven approach to identify critical suppliers hidden in a US state's leading manufacturers' supply network. From this work, 43 companies were identified as hidden critical suppliers in an initial analysis, of which 35 had no presence in the analyzed state (82%). All of them were contacted for possible future economic development endeavors. It is also important to mention that 15 of the 43 critical suppliers were in semiconductor-related industries (35%). This data was collected in the fall of 2020, before the worldwide semiconductor shortage, illustrating the potential to identify industries with greater supply chain resiliency risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on nickel ore products, selecting eight major participating countries or regions from 2000 to 2021. Based on a whole industrial chain perspective, a Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) window model is constructed to reveal the inherent mechanisms of risk transmission in the nickel ore industrial and supply chain. The security levels of nickel industrial and supply chains for each country are evaluated from both a holistic and specific level, and the superiority of the model is compared and demonstrated. The results indicate: (1) The security levels of Australia, China, ASEAN, and New Caledonia are relatively high, demonstrating effective resilience against risks, while the security levels of the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Russia are relatively low. (2) Based on the fluctuation trends of security levels, the United States, Australia, Canada, and Russia exhibit irregular fluctuating declining trends, while other countries or regions show relatively stable trends; (3) Through dual-perspective analysis, it is found that upstream vulnerability is relatively weak for consumption powerhouses like the United States and China, but the security levels in the midstream and downstream are relatively high, resulting in weaker fluctuations in security levels caused by upstream risk transmission. On the other hand, resource-rich countries or regions like ASEAN and New Caledonia have weaker midstream and downstream sectors, making them susceptible to the impact of upstream risk transmission, leading to stronger fluctuations in midstream and downstream security levels; (4) Through comparison, it is confirmed that the NDEA window model, relative to traditional methods, better captures the interconnections of various stages in the industrial and supply chain, highlighting its advantages in improving deviations in security level assessments. The results of this study, combined with real-world situations, provide an important reference value for the development of the whole industrial chain of critical minerals in various countries. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This study, leveraging 2022 trade data and inter-linkage dependencies within the niobium industry, constructs a multi-layer network model and simulates the impact and propagation of supply disruptions under two realistic scenarios: Restrictions on primary product exports and total export bans. Our findings reveal that: (1) Supply constraints on primary products cascade through the middle and downstream trade networks, impacting the final product layer more severely, especially for countries with limited ability to cope with disruptions. (2) China, Malaysia, Brazil, and the United States emerge as crucial risk sources, with their export restrictions potentially triggering a complete collapse of trade networks across all layers. (3) Hidden risk sources include Asian countries like Japan and Korea in the primary product layer, while European nations like the United Kingdom and Germany, despite playing a limited role in upstream disruptions, significantly influence the intermediate and final product layers. These findings underscore the importance of developing feasible systemic risk mitigation strategies, optimizing industrial structures, fostering global cooperation, and ultimately bolstering the robustness and resilience of the global niobium industry chain. © © 2024 Luo, Liu, Qin, Qu and Liu.

To do so, we examine the global dry bulk shipping network and its coal, grain, and iron ore sub-networks from 2015 to 2023 using micro-level trade flow data. We find that these networks are highly concentrated around a small number of key export ports, with heavy-tailed degree distributions and strong core-periphery structures. However, the impact of external shocks is sharply commodity-specific: the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a major reorganisation of coal trade communities, while the war in Ukraine fragmented the grain network and drastically reduced Ukraine’s exports. In contrast, iron ore trade patterns remained relatively stable during the same period. Small-world features are present mainly within the densely interconnected core of each commodity network, where bi-directional trades are observed, while most peripheral ports function as either importers or exporters only. These findings clarify how the interplay of geography, trade imbalance, and global disruptions shapes network structure and resilience, offering insights for supply chain risk management in maritime logistics. © 2025 The Author(s).

Visibility within quality assurance processes is critical to this and is particularly important for autonomous & driver-less vehicles which rely on correct operation of individual parts (in the absence of human intervention) to achieve safety of such vehicles. Failure to ascertain quality assurance of parts can result in rogue behaviour among driver-less vehicles which can result in a risk to human lives. In this paper, a blockchain-based approach - TruCert, is proposed which achieves trustworthy product certification through enhanced visibility within tier 1 and beyond for complex automotive supply chains. Leveraging blockchain technology, TruCert's potential to improve product quality assurance is demonstrated whilst also strengthening supply chain resilience to combat risks and uncertainties. Utilising the use-case of autonomous connected vehicles manufacturing, design and development of TruCert solution is presented including detailed system design, data model, and smart contracts & oracle implementations. TruCert enables trustworthy part certification across supply chain beyond tier 1 whilst achieving interoperability with heterogeneous systems across suppliers and other stakeholders. Outcomes of evaluation with respect to cost, performance, and security are also presented which highlight the effectiveness of the approach whilst identifying directions for future work. © 2023 The Author(s)

While global manufacturing networks often suffer the risks of oversupply and shortage of key components, the distributor that is the key intermediate participator in electronics product supply chain buys components from the suppliers, warehouses them, and resells different parts to a number of electronics manufacturers with vendor-managed inventories. Thus, the component distributors forecast the demands for large assortments of stock keeping units (SKUs) with distinct dynamics for inventory control and supply chain management. To address realistic needs to enhance demand forecast performance, this study aims to develop a UNISON data-driven analytics framework that integrates machine learning technologies and temporal aggregation mechanism to forecast the demands of intermittent electronics components. An empirical study is conducted in a world-leading semiconductor distributor for validation. The results have shown practical vitality of the proposed approach with better performance than conventional approaches and the existing practice.

However, knowledge of global vanadium flow patterns remains limited. Here, we employed material flow analysis associated with complex network analysis to reconstruct the global anthropogenic vanadium cycle from 1988 to 2023 and to characterize the trade patterns across the global vanadium supply chain. The results show that 4291.2 kt of vanadium was extracted from mining during this period, with 2310.3 kt entering the global market as refined products. High-strength low-alloy steel (30.8%) and carbon steel (28.0%) dominated semifinished product consumption, while the buildings and infrastructure (34.1%) and transport (30.2%) sectors were the major contributors to in-use stocks. While the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany played pivotal roles in maintaining global trade connectivity, China emerged as the dominant exporter of downstream vanadium products. Analyses of the network efficiency and supply concentration highlight the structural fragility of the global vanadium supply chain. Mitigating potential supply risks requires coordinated global efforts to enhance collaboration, improve utilization efficiency, and strengthen recycling from in-use stocks. © 2025 American Chemical Society

Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the resilience measures for supply chain network designs (SCND) structures: centralized, decentralized, and distributed. Using a global survey of over 900 supply chain professionals, quantitative methods are employed to analyze associations between the SCND structures and eight resilience strategies along with 18 capabilities. Findings: Findings reveal that distributed supply chains exhibit higher associations with 14 of the resilience measures. Distributed networks offer greater responsiveness and robustness in response to disruptions by more effectively enabling anticipation, sustainability, visibility, flexibility, adaptability, strategic alignment, and supply chain collaboration, compared to centralized networks. The survey responses also confirm two distinct factor classifications for resilience capabilities, which are consistent with the proactive and reactive measures commonly reported in the literature. Practical implications: Understanding the role of different SCNDs in fostering resilience is indispensable for organizations to enhance their risk mitigation practices, ensure the long-term continuity of their performance, and leverage the flexibility of the composable enterprise to quickly adapt to disruptions. Originality/value: This research addresses a critical gap in the existing literature by providing empirical, data-driven insights into how different SCNDs are associated with supply chain resilience. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19 are considered a type of risk to supply chains (SCs) affecting SC performance. Healthcare SC performance can be assessed using advanced Management Science (MS) and Operations Research (OR) approaches to improve the efficiency of existing healthcare systems when confronted by pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19 and Influenza. This paper intends to develop a novel network range directional measure (RDM) approach for evaluating the sustainability and resilience of healthcare SCs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. First, we propose a non-radial network RDM method in the presence of negative data. Then, the model is extended to deal with the different types of data such as ratio, integer, undesirable, and zero in efficiency measurement of sustainable and resilient healthcare SCs. To mitigate conditions of uncertainty in performance evaluation results, we use chance-constrained programming (CCP) for the developed model. The proposed approach suggests how to improve the efficiency of healthcare SCs. We present a case study, along with managerial implications, demonstrating the applicability and usefulness of the proposed model. The results show how well our proposed model can assess the sustainability and resilience of healthcare supply chains in the presence of dissimilar types of data and how, under different conditions, the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) changes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Using panel data from 1517 Chinese A-share listed companies (2013–2023), we employ fixed-effects regression with instrumental variables to examine these pathways. Results show extreme climate risk significantly reduces financial performance, yet operates through three transmission mechanisms creating measurable benefits: green innovation intensity, environmental governance investment, and social responsibility investment generate positive returns that partially offset direct climate damages. Supply chain localization provides protection by enabling better coordination during disruptions, while ESG transparency gaps amplify vulnerability through damaged stakeholder trust. These findings reveal the climate adaptation paradox—resilience depends less on geographic location than on strategic positioning within innovation ecosystems, governance structures, and stakeholder networks, where adaptation represents risk mitigation rather than value creation. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The uncertainty created by COVID-19 makes it is difficult for various industries to deal with the pandemic. Since the pandemic, the supply chain's resilience has been discussed and examined in some studies. However, most existing works start from a single industry perspective or pay more attention to the disturbance caused by changes in the production side. Supply chain networks of different industries, mainly transport networks, are relatively limited under the epidemic's impact. In this paper, from the perspective of highway freight transport, a comprehensive competitiveness evaluation framework was proposed to reveal and the disruption and resilience of the supply chain under the outbreak based on nine indexes with five dimensions, including efficiency, capacity, activity, connectivity, and negotiability. Based on the availability of the data(Large-scale truck trajectory), we sorted out seven categories of Chinese industries(related to highway transport) and divided them into four categories respectively: (a) Slight disruption and worse resilience; (b) Slight disruption and remarkable resilience; (c) Serious disruption and worse resilience; (d) Serious disruption and remarkable resilience. The measurement results of supply chain network performance show that the industries (cold-chain, general products, and other industries) dominated by “Efficiency - Negotiability - Connectivity” are slightly disrupted (about 33%), forming a spatial diffusion with Wuhan(the city where the pandemic first broke out) as the disrupted center, spreading outward in a circle structure. Simultaneously, five urban agglomerations surrounding it have been impacted. By contrast, due to the strict isolation measures, the industries (building materials, construction, engineering, and high-value products industry) more vulnerable to be disrupted seriously (about 82%) tend to be the pattern of “Capacity - Activity”. However, a large-scale centralized disruption was observed in the Triangle of Central China urban agglomeration was presented, resulting in almost stagnation of industry development. Meanwhile, as the future of the pandemic remains uncertain, the supply chain represented by the engineering industry, construction industry, etc are deserved to be paid more attention in line with they are prone to large-scale centralized damage due to the disruption of a single city node. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
