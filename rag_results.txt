Q: How is resilience conceptualized in the supply chain literature, and what core dimensions recur across studies?

A: Based on the provided sources, resilience in the supply chain literature can be conceptualized as the ability to withstand disruptions and operate effectively despite operational risks. The core dimensions that recur across studies include:

* Technology adoption and management
* Collaboration among stakeholders
* Continuous improvement and learning from failures
* Adaptability and flexibility in responding to changing market conditions

These dimensions are essential for building robust and adaptable supply chains, which can help mitigate the negative impacts of turbulence and volatility on food supply chains.

Q: What categories of supply chain risk are most frequently discussed, and how are they commonly structured or classified?

A: The main categories of supply chain risk discussed in the sources are:

1. Operational risks (e.g., disruption risks) that can impact supply chain performance.
2. Disruptive risks (e.g., environmental risks) that can also impact supply chain operations.

These two types of risks are often categorized into three subcategories, which are mentioned separately in some sources:

* Supply risks
* Demand risks
* Supply chain organization risks

The categorization of supply chain risk is also discussed, with different sources suggesting the following seven main categories, grouped as follows:

* Turbulence
* Threats
* Connectivity
* Outside pressures
* Resource boundaries
* Sensitivity
* Supplier or customer distractions

Q: How are network concepts used to explain disruption propagation and vulnerability in supply chains?

A: Network concepts are used to explain disruption propagation and vulnerability in supply chains by:

1. Modeling complex causal relationships between interdependent tiers.
2. Identifying vulnerable nodes in supply chain networks, which can fail or produce significant disruptions.
3. Developing tiered resilience strategies based on the identified vulnerabilities.

These approaches reduce disruption propagation probability compared to linear structures, making them effective for assessing and mitigating supply chain risks.

Q: What types of data are used to study supply chain risk and resilience, and how are they typically operationalized?

A: Supply chain risk and resilience are typically studied using data such as:

* Performance metrics on logistics performance, such as on-time delivery and cost efficiency
* Network structure information, including carrier and region connectivity

These types of data are often used to operationalize supply chain resilience by identifying key indicators that can help predict disruptions and inform decision-making.

Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze these datasets and identify patterns indicative of potential disruptions, thereby enhancing supply chain visibility and resilience.

Q: How do studies integrate risk, network structure, and data in analytical approaches to improve supply chain resilience?

A: Studies that integrate risk, network structure, and data in analytical approaches aim to improve supply chain resilience by better understanding supply chain complexity and how entities are interrelated.

A machine learning approach is used to enhance supply chain visibility with graph-based learning, providing insights into supply chain structure and behavior.

A unified framework for evaluating supply chain reliability and resilience is proposed, addressing the need to quantify SCRR and its impact on resilience.

Network nestedness is found to contribute to vulnerability and enhancement of resilience simultaneously in supply chains.

A methodological framework is developed to design efficient resilience in supply networks, prioritizing understanding the effects of disruptions on SNs.
